# - Find the native SOCI includes and library
#
# This module defines
#  SOCICPP_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find soci.h, etc.
#  SOCICPP_LIBRARY_DIRS, the libraries to link against to use SOCI.
#  SOCI_DEFINITIONS - You should add_definitons(${SOCI_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code that includes png library files.
#  SOCI_FOUND, If false, do not try to use SOCI.
# also defined, but not for general use are
#  SOCICPP_LIBRARY_DIRS, where to find the SOCI library.
# None of the above will be defined unles zlib can be found.
# SOCI depends on Zlib

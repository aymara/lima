The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced " no evidence " that any irregularities took place.
The jury further said in term - end presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all charge of the election, " deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta " for the manner in which the election was conducted.
The September - October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye - to investigate reports of possible " irregularities " in the hard - fought primary which was won by Mayor - nominate Ivan Allen Jr.
" Only a relative handful of such reports was received ", the jury said -, " considering the widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size of this city ".
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws " are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ".
It recommended that Fulton legislators act " to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them ".
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said " - - are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ".
.
MERGER PROPOSED.
However, the jury said it believes " these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ".
The City Purchasing Department, the jury said -, " is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ".
It urged that the city " take steps to remedy " this problem.
Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law - was also recommended by the outgoing jury.
It urged that the next Legislature " provide enabling funds and re - set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected ".
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds - granted for child welfare services in foster homes.
" This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program " -, the jury said, but the State Welfare Department " has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives none of this money ".
The jurors said they realize " a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties ".
Nevertheless, " we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds ", the jurors said.
" Failure to do this will continue - to place a disproportionate burden " on Fulton taxpayers.
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.
.
WARDS PROTECTED.
The jury said it found the court " has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations " of two previous grand juries, the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee.
" These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms ", the jury said.
Regarding Atlanta's new multi - million - dollar airport, the jury recommended " that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that - will eliminate political influences ".
The jury did not elaborate, but it added that " there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ".
.
ASK JAIL DEPUTIES.
On other matters, the jury recommended that : (1).
Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and " a doctor, medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail ".
(2).
Fulton legislators " work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that - will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable " pension plan for city employes.
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office, the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department.

Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a top official said Wednesday.
Robert Snodgrass, state GOP chairman, said a meeting - held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience.
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm - was picking up for a state rally - to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker.
In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it - to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.
Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended.
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted - to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no and there were no dissents.
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face - is a state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative courses - must be taken : 1..
Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions - requesting that the Republicans be allowed - to place names of candidates on the general election ballot, or 2..
The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform.

The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home where some of the highway bond money it approved - will follow shortly.
Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the Senate is expected - to approve a study of the number of legislators - allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made.
Gov. Vandiver is expected - to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment.
Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue - approved earlier in the session as his first priority item.
.
CONSTRUCTION BONDS.
Meanwhile, it was learned the State Highway Department is very near - being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds.
The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways.
A Highway Department source said there also is a plan - there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.
.
A REVOLVING FUND.
The department apparently intends - to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities -.
Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds - proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin.
The Highway Department source told The Constitution, however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds.
Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution - Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.
Pelham said Sunday night there was research - being done on whether the " quickie " vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice - would have - to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought.
While emphasizing that technical details - were not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek - to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 - 31.
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29 - 5.
As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution - being offered there to rescind the action.
Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators - to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday - to back federal aid to education, something it - has consistently opposed - in the past.
Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution - to " endorse increased federal support for public education, provided that such funds be received and expended " as state funds.
Barber, who is in his 13th year as a legislator, said there " are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like - to see it (the resolution) passed ".
But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him - to offer the resolution.
The resolution, which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday, - will be formally read Monday.
It says that " in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds ", the State Board of Education should be directed - to " give priority " to teacher pay raises.
COLQUITT.
After a long, hot controversy, Miller County has a new school superintendent, - elected, as a policeman put it, in the " coolest election I ever saw - in this county ".
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a veteran agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush, a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee.
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election, and Bush got 402.
Ordinary Carey Williams, - armed with a pistol, stood by at the polls to insure order.
" This was the coolest, calmest election I ever saw - ", Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said.
" Being at the polls was just like being at church.
I did n't smell a drop of liquor, and we did n't have a bit of trouble ".
The campaign - leading to the election was not so quiet, however.
It was marked by controversy, anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence.
The former county school superintendent, George P. Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.
During the election campaign, both candidates, Davis and Bush, reportedly received anonymous telephone calls.
Ordinary Williams said he, too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election.
Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise.
" Everything went real smooth ", the sheriff said.
" There was n't a bit of trouble ".
AUSTIN, TEXAS.
Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's " abandoned property " act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers.
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.
Under committee rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week.
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers - appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.
Daniel termed " extremely conservative " his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31.
He told the committee the measure - would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books " since Texas was a republic ".
It permits the state - to take over bank accounts, stocks and other personal property of persons - missing for seven years or more.
The bill, which Daniel said he drafted - personally, would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other corporations - to report such property to the state treasurer.
The escheat law can not be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property, Daniel declared.
Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler lawyer - representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks - to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers.
" If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something to the economy ", he said.
" You take out of circulation many millions of dollars ".
Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman, sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount " to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance and pipeline companies ".
His contention was denied by several bankers, including Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B. Jones of Houston, J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.
Cox argued that the bill is " probably unconstitutional " since, he said, it would impair contracts.
He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing, since the bill was introduced only last Monday.
AUSTIN, TEXAS.
Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas - authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House.
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency - to establish county - wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age - to attend the day schools, permitting older ones - to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here.
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed, Parkhouse told the Senate.
The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County, saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.

DALLAS MAY GET to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. (Red) Berry and Joe Ratcliff.
While details are still to be worked out, Ratcliff said he expects - to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected.
" We're getting more <lsquo> pro <rsquo> letters than <lsquo> con <rsquo> on horse race betting ", said Ratcliff.
" But I believe if people were better informed on this question, most of them would oppose it also.
I'm willing to stake my political career on it ".
Rep. Berry, an ex - gambler from San Antonio, got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies.
A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected - to give it a favorable report, although the resolution faces hard sledding later.

TWO TAX REVISION bills were passed.
One, by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba, would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized.

AUSTIN, TEXAS.
State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer - to pay -.
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot, when Texas votes on a U.S. senator.
Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole, sponsor of the poll idea, said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill.
The West Texan reported that he - had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee - to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22.
The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval, by two - thirds majorities, before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot, Roberts said.
Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice.
All Dallas members voted with Roberts, except Rep. Bill Jones, who was absent.
AUSTIN, TEXAS.
Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday.
Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill - passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet of 250 people.
When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114 to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas.
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse.
The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make - to a local water project.
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities - get money which Cotten felt - - could better be spent providing water for rural Texas.
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway Cotten's attack.
The bill's defenders were mostly small - town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio (Kika) de la Garza of Mission, Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs.
" This is a poor boy's bill ", said Chapman.
" Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds.
This would help the little peanut districts ".
AUSTIN, TEXAS.

Grover also would require junior - senior high teachers - to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching -.
The remainder of the 4 - year college requirement would be in general subjects.
" A person with a master's degree in physics, chemistry, math or English, yet who has not taken Education courses, is not permitted - to teach in the public schools ", said Grover.
College teachers in Texas are not required - to have the Education courses.
Fifty - three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co - signers of the proposal.

State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for - yesterday in a report of a " blue ribbon " citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program.
The report, - culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm, listed 10 long range recommendations - designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load.
The report called racial discrimination in employment " one of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion, and ADC dependency ".
.
" MUST SOLVE PROBLEM ".
The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars, said C. Virgil Martin, president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co., committee chairman.
" We must solve the problems which have forced these people - to depend upon ADC for subsistence ", Martin said.
The volume of ADC cases will decrease -, Martin reported, when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color.
These, he said -, are " two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups - leading to ADC ".
.
CALLS FOR EXTENSION.
Other recommendations - made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need - living with any relatives, including both parents, as a means of preserving family unity.
- Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.
Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements - indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday.
The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys - representing the eight former policemen - now on trial.
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons - to grant his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial.
Bellows made the request while the all - woman jury was out of the courtroom.
.
FEARS PREJUDICIAL ASPECTS.
" The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client ", Bellows told the court.
" Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property.
It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements - involving themselves and others ".
Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired, " You mean some of the defendants made statements - admitting this " ? " Yes, your honor ", replied Bellows.
" What this amounts to -, if true, is that there will be a free - for - all fight in this case.
There is a conflict among the defendants ".
WASHINGTON, JULY 24.
President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver - tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio.
The President spent much of the week - end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.
Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port, Mass., a White House spokesman said the address text still had " quite a way - to go " toward completion.
.
DECISIONS ARE MADE.
- Asked - to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White House press secretary, replied, " I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts ".
Salinger said the work President Kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing - on the address involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis - precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city.
The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns, who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence " by unfair and fundamentally illegal means ".
Karns said that the cases involved a matter " of even greater - significance than the guilt or innocence " of the 50 persons.
He said evidence was obtained " in violation of the legal rights of citizens ".
Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases.
In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been " unable to make a case ".
Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler, special prosecutor.
.
ISSUE JURY SUBPENAS.
Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons - involved in the election investigation, questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them before the grand jury.
Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure constituted intimidation.
Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning.
Karns said it was a " wrongful act " for Wexler to take statements " privately and outside of the grand jury room ".
He said this constituted a " very serious misuse " of the Criminal court processes.
" Actually, the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court ", said Karns, who is a City judge in East St. Louis - sitting in Cook County court.
.
FACED SEVEN CASES.
Karns had been scheduled this week - to hear seven cases - involving 35 persons.
Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with " complementary " miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another.
The cases involved judges in the 33d, 24th, and 42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward, and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.
The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns.
Two other cases also were under advisement.
.
CLAIMS PRECEDENT LACKING.
After reading his statement - discharging the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases - scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he would dismiss them.
WASHINGTON, FEB. 9.
President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs.
The President, in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships, build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child health care and general medical research.
The aged care plan, similar to one the President sponsored - last year as a senator, a fight on Capitol hill.
It was defeated in Congress last year.
.
COST UP TO $37 A YEAR.
It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers - now paying such taxes.
The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent 3 per cent on each worker and employer on the first $4,800 of pay per year.
The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent 3.25 per cent each.
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system.
The payroll tax - would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because the levy - is already scheduled - to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs.
.
OUTLAYS WOULD INCREASE.
Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits - paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963.
Both figures would go higher in later years.
Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years.
These would be paid for - out of general, not payroll, taxes.
.
NURSING HOME CARE.
The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1..
Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.
2..
Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital.
A patient could receive up to 300 days paid - for nursing home care under a " unit formula " - allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital - care credit.
3..
Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient.
4..
Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness.
The President noted that Congress last year passed a law - providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged.
.
CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST.
He said his plan is designed to " meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who - are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children - caused by an extended hospital stay ".
" This is a very modest proposal - cut to meet absolutely essential needs ", he said -, " and with sufficient <lsquo> deductible <rsquo> requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.
" This is not a program of socialized medicine.
It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed.
Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital ".
.
WOULD N'T PAY DOCTORS.
The plan does not cover doctor bills.
They - would still be paid by the patient.
Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships, and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools - can not now handle the student load - needed to meet the rising need for health care.
Moreover, he said -, many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they ca n't afford the schooling costs.
.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOOLS.
The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one - fourth of the first year students.
The schools could use the money to pay 4 - year scholarships, - based on need, of up to $2,000 a year per student.
In addition, the government would pay a $1,000 " cost of education " grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants.
Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966.
The President recommended federal " matching grants " - totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones.
.
MORE FOR NURSING HOMES.
In the area of " community health services ", the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction.
He asked for another 10 million dollar " initial " appropriation for " stimulatory grants " to states to improve nursing homes.
He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.
In the child health field, the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau.
He also asked Congress - to approve establishment of a national child health institute.
.
ASKS RESEARCH FUNDS.
The President said he will ask Congress - to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.
He did not say by how much.
For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions, in matching grants for building research facilities.
The President said he - will also propose - increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540 million dollars in the 1961 - 62 budget for direct government research in medicine.
The President said his proposals combine the " indispensable elements in a sound health program people, knowledge, services, facilities, and the means to pay for them ".
.
REACTION AS EXPECTED.
Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines.
Legislators who last year opposed - placing aged - care under the social security system criticized the President's plan.
Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.
Senate Republican Leader Dirksen [ Ill. ] and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck [ Ind. ] said the message did not persuade them - to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance.
Halleck said the voluntary care plan - enacted last year should be given a fair trial first.
House Speaker Sam Rayburn [ D., Tex. ] called the Kennedy program " a mighty fine thing ", but made no prediction on its fate in the House.
WASHINGTON, FEB. 9.
Acting hastily under White House pressure, the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief.
Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote.
A number of scattered " ayes " and " noes " was heard.
Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency.
In the last eight years, all Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule - requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.
.
ENFORCE BY DEMAND.
The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse [ D., Ore. ] in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961.
OSLO.
The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer, franker, and wider discussions, - animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings.
This has been a working session of an organization that -, by its very nature, - can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes.
In Oslo, the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations - are concerned between the " colonialist " powers and those who - have never, or not for a long time, had such problems.
The nightmare of a clash between those - in trouble - in Africa, - exacerbated by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies - facing them, and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that - have brought these troubles about, has been conspicious by its absence.
.
EXPLOSION AVOIDED.
In the case of Portugal, which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension.
The general, remarkably courteous, explanation has left basic positions unchanged, but there has been no explosion in the council.
There - should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes, since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive.
Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance, is today closer to the NATO line.
On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as - much in evidence as hoped for.
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as " inconclusive ".
But he hastened - to add that, if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West, this - may merely mean the new administration - - has not yet firmly fixed its policy.
.
EXPLORATORY MOOD.
A certain vagueness - may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited.
The impression - has nevertheless been given during these three days, despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity, that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots.
The Secretary of State himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that - has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months.
But where the core of NATO is concerned, the Secretary of State - has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance, " cornerstone " of its foreign policy, but has announced that five nuclear submarines - will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters.
The Secretary of State - - has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation - once again taken up by the council as a whole.
.
CONFLICT SURVEYED.
The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East - West friction, wherever it take place around the globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection.
The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more, deeper, and more timely political consultation within the alliance, the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (when ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries, and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.
This increase in the " threshold ", as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come.
Each ally will have to carry out obligations - long since laid down, but never completely fulfilled.
WASHINGTON.
The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time.
There is little optimism - here that the Communists will be - any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.
The United States, State Department officials explain -, now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam.
They count on the aid of the neutral countries - attending the Geneva conference to achieve this.
The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated.
But it is apparent that no acceptable formula - has been found to prevent such a possibility.
.
POLICIES MODIFIED.
The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference.
This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled - to make -.
It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors - made in the previous administration.
Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.
But with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world the question - arises : How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ? Former Vice - President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union.
He was critical of what he feels - is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.
.
GOP RESTRAINED.
It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it.
They - can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans, if they had been in power, would have made " amateurish and monumental blunders " in Cuba.
One Republican senator told this correspondent that he - was constantly being asked why he did n't attack the Kennedy administration on this score.
His reply, he said -, was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now.
But he further said that it was better politics to let others - question the wisdom of administration policies first.
The Republicans some weeks ago served notice - through Senator Thruston B. Morton (R) of Kentucky, chairman of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination.
Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard, Boston University, Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators.
.
DETENTE URGED.
This group pleads with the administration - to " give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups ".
It recommends that the United States " seek instead - to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds ".
Mr. Nixon, for his part, would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation.
But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos, almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that - respected, generally, the opinions - voiced both by - Mr. Nixon and the professors.
.
AID PLANS REVAMPED.
Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels -, a high official source disclosed, that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration.
Strenuous efforts - were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements.
Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed.
But thus far there has been no response in kind.
Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations.
In Laos, the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture.
Again and again it asked the Communists - to " freeze " the military situation in Laos.
But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.
And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build - up, administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a " great service " and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos.
But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation - at any one time for the United States to want - to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.
(Some SEATO nations disagreed, however.
) There was the further complication that the administration - had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.
The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos.
The pro - Western government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma " neutralist " government, never did appear - to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.
There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro - Western government to the hilt.
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt - was too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.
One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright (D) of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by " encouraging the removal " of Prince Souvanna.
WASHINGTON.
The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the " vitality of the nation ".
In an important assertion of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive order - establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime, - to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.
The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.
.
OFFENSES MULTIPLY.
The President - has also called upon the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and the Secretary of Labor - to coordinate their efforts " in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.
Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett, a special assistant ot the Attorney General, as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime.
His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests - have more than doubled since 1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.
Among arrests - reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959, about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full - time director, Raymond H. Hawksley, the present city CD head, believes.
Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council " or anyone else locally " to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.
East Providence now has no civil defense program.
Mr. Hawksley, the state's general treasurer, has been a part - time CD director in the city for the last nine years.
He is not interested in being named a full - time director.
Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program, Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full - time local director.
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and - would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.
Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full - time CD job.
One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin, he said.
Along with a director, the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.
Mr. Hawksley said.
One advantage that - would come to the city in having a full - time director, he said -, is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment - needed for a sound civil defense program.
Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks, he said.
Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks, similar to the CD vehicle - obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station.
He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area.
Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city, Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.
The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point -, he said, and a drive - in theater in Seekonk would be another.
Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point.
Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack.
Such vital information, he said -, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know.
If the city council fails - to consider appointment of a full - time CD director, Mr. Hawksley said -, then he plans - to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally.
One of the first things he would do -, he said -, would be to organize classes in first aid.
Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government.
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind.
Governor Notte said last night he plans - to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly.
The governor's move into the so-called " blue law " controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls.
A copy was released to the press.
Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution - adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant.
The resolution urges the governor - to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature.
While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review, Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get " the benefit of his views ".
He - will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation, the governor said.
" I would expect the proposed committee - to hold public hearings ", Mr. Notte said -, " to obtain the views of the general public and religious, labor and special - interest groups - affected by these laws ".
The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time " with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws - regulating Sunday sales ".
The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws.
Should there be evidence they are shirking, he has said -, the state police will step into the situation.
There has been more - activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws.
The statutes, - similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely limit the types of merchandise that - may be sold on the Sabbath.
The Central Falls City Council expressed concern - especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed - to do business on Sunday.
The only day they " have a chance to compete with large supermarkets - is on Sunday ", the council's resolution said.
The small shops " must be retained, for they provide essential service to the community ", according to the resolution, which added that they " also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors ".
It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide " great revenue " to the local government.
The council advised the governor that " large supermarkets, factory outlets and department stores not be allowed - to do business " on Sunday.
They " operate on a volume basis ", it was contended -, " and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community ".
Liberals and conservatives in both parties Democratic and Republican should divorce themselves and form two independent parties, George H. Reama, nationally known labor - management expert, said here yesterday.
Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton - Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the " welfare " type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system.
He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day.
He said he was " confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 ".
That, he added -, was when he was " a very young man, a machinist and toolmaker by trade.
" That was before I studied law.
Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party.
The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track.
He steered me to the right track the free enterprise track ".
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources.
He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory, most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties.
Mr. Reama, who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said, " Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product but neither told us how to achieve it ".
He said he favors wage increases for workers " but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze " and raises - should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices, he added.
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy, Mr. Reama said : " A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own - ".
Mr. Reama, far from really being retired, is engaged in industrial relations counseling.
A petition - bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped - will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.
William A. Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted - to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr.
The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post.
Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days.
He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work.
A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact manner in which the vote is handled.
Mr. Martinelli - has, in recent weeks, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote, while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead.
Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions - favoring both procedures.
He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible.
Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement.
He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present, but that it - will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.
" After inspiring this, I think we - should certainly follow through on it ", he declared.
" It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement ".
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non - partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission.
" Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement ", he indicated -, " and to tell them what this will mean for the town ".
He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September.
Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks, it was indicated.
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group - to obtain signatures under what were termed " false pretenses ".
Several signers affixed their names -, it was learned, after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision - could be included in the charter to have the town - take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system.
Action on a new ordinance - permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses - to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting.
Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council - - to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno - to draft the ordinance.
At the last session of the General Assembly, the town was authorized - to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition.
Local police have hesitated - to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs - involved even for the simplest offense.
PLAINFIELD.
James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R - Bergen, last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial candidate, that the GOP is " Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism ".
Mitchell was for using it, Jones against, and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R - Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel.
The controversial remark - was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club.
It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.
Hughes said Monday, " It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism, but the heart stopped - beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired.
Now he's gone, the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state ".
Sunday he had added, " We can love Eisenhower the man, even if we considered him a mediocre president... but there is nothing - left of the Republican Party without his leadership ".
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign.
" How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this " ? he asked.
The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican " and proud to have absorbed his philosophy " while working in his adminstration.
Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue.
.
REGRETS ATTACK.
Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president.
" He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign ", he said -, " because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re - arguing an old national campaign ".
The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark.
Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary.
He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign.
State aid to schools, the continuance of railroad passenger service, the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority, and making New Jersey attractive to new industry.
.
DECRIES JOBLESSNESS.
Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican - controlled State Senate " Must share the blame for this ".
Nothing that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant, he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform.
" But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time ", Mitchell said.
Jones, unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions, saved his barbs for Mitchell.
He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises.
" He calls for help while saying he is against centralization, but you ca n't have it both ways ", Jones said.
The state - is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities, real estate or motor vehicles, he said -, " and I challenge Mitchell - to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue ".
.
DEFENDS IKE.
Earlier, Mitchell said in a statement : " I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements - made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes.
His reference to <lsquo> discredited carcass <rsquo> or <lsquo> tattered remains <rsquo> of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history, to the man who - was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States, and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace - loving intentions of the free nations.
" I find it hard to understand how anyone - seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste.
" Such a vicious statement - can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature.
It - can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit ".
.
SEES JONES AHEAD.
Sen. Charles W. Sandman, R - Cape May, said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination.
Sandman, state campaign chairman for Jones, was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel, Newark, of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones.
Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority - given a candidate in recent years.
Sandman said : " The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case R - N.J., has decided - to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway.
It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he can not answer any questions about New Jersey's problems.
" We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington.
That failed.
" We - are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year.
That, too, will fail ".
Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave., Westfield, as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee.
Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman.
County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets, who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them.
The proposal, Sheets said -, represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a " lip service word ".
Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines, enabling counties - to repay the loan over a 10 - year period without interest or charge.
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January, 1964.
Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation - impinging on home rule is basically distasteful, he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines.
The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange, for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County, was supported today by Edward W. Roos, West Orange public safety commissioner.
Sheeran, a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization's candidate, Freeholder William MacDonald, for the vacancy - left by the resignation of Neil Duffy, - now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals.
" My experience as public safety commissioner ", Roos said -, " has shown me that the office of sheriff - is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience, and preferably one who is a lawyer.
Jim Sheeran fits that description ".
TRENTON.
William J. Seidel, state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development, has retired after 36 years of service.
A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state.
Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies.
In October 1944, he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section.
Under his supervision, the state fire - fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting.
He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station.
He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens.
He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co - operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education.
BOONTON.
Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge " to carry the issues to every corner of the state ".
He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : " When I come back here after the November election you'll think, <lsquo> You're my man you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected - <rsquo> ".
He said, " We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just, and not what is expedient at the time ".
.
ATTACKS REPUBLICANS.
In his only attack on the Republicans, Hughes said, " The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary.
But we'll have a liberal, well planned, forward looking, honest platform.
We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson.
" We'll take the truth to the people, and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November ".
He said, " You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration.
But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead ".
He urged New Jersey - to " become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy ".
He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states, and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry.
" We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean ", the former Superior Court judge said.
" To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s ".
Calling the Democrats the " party that - lives, breathes and thinks for the good of the people ", Hughes asked, " a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November ".
Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's " Green Acres " plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development.
He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected - to be introduced Monday.
.
CONSERVATION PLAN.
The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state.
The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis.
Hughes said, " This is not a plan to conquer space but to conserve it ", pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950.
He said " Morris County - is rapidly changing and unless - steps are taken to preserve the green areas, there will be no - land left to preserve ".
Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved.
He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans.
" After the primary ", he promised -, " I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong, dynamic administration.
I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee ".
TRENTON.
Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring voluntarily this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues.
The outgoing members, whose four - year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election, received carved wooden elephants, complete with ivory tusks, to remember the state committee by -.
There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18, but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters.
A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank, who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee.
She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment.
She served one four - year term on the national committee.
Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided - to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates.
At the same time reaction among anti - organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable.
Some anti - organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that - has been going on for the last three years.
The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders.
Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party.
.
OPPOSITION REPORTED.
Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported - trying - to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn - to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary.
These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city.
Their view is that last - minute changes the Mayor is proposing - to make - in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor.
In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate, Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley, the Bronx Democratic leader, and with Joseph T. Sharkey, the Brooklyn Democratic leader.
.
MAYOR VISITS BUCKLEY.
As usual, he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio, the Manhattan leader.
He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party.
Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation.
Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle.
In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington, the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa, who lives in the Bronx, from this year's ticket.
But Mr. Buckley seems - to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor.
.
SCREVANE AND BEAME HAILED.
The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday - to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided - to run and wanted Mr. Screvane, who lives in Queens, - to replace Abe Stark, the incumbent, as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame, who lives in Brooklyn, - to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller.
The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx.
After his speech, reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions, - published in yesterday's New York Times.
The Mayor said : " It did n't come from me.
But as I have said before, if I announce my candidacy, I will have something definite - to say about running mates ".
BOSTON, JUNE 16.
A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts.
There is a tangible feeling - in the air of revulsion toward politics.
The taxi driver - taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are " all the same ".
" It's <lsquo> See Joe, see Jim <rsquo> ", he says.
" The hand is out ".
A political scientist writes of the growth of " alienated voters ", who " believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt, selfish and beyond popular control.
... These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy, the object of which is to plunder them ".
Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that - - were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel, " The Last Hurrah ".
But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject.
A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year.
Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations.
And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state.
A reader of the Boston newspapers - can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery, or worse, is the norm in Massachusetts public life.
Day after day some new episode is reported.
The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property.
An assistant attorney general is directed - to investigate.
WASHINGTON, JUNE 18.
Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.
In the Senate, several bills are expected - to pass without any major conflict or opposition.
In the House, the Southern - Republican coalition is expected - to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill, while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid - to - education bill.
The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee.
It is expected - to be reported out Tuesday, but this is a little uncertain.
The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble, Democrat of Arkansas, who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor.
Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday.
.
LEADERSHIP IS HOPEFUL.
The housing bill is expected - to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans.
The Democratic leadership, however, hopes - to pass it sometime this week.
The $6,100,000,000 measure, which was passed last Monday by the Senate, provides for forty - year mortgages at low down - payments for moderate - income families.
It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges - build dormitories.
The education bill appears - - to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee, where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy.
They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts.
.
THREE GROUPS TO MEET.
What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill - amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958.
This would provide for long - term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private - school facilities for teaching science, languages and mathematics.
Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public - school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee.
About half of all Peace Corps projects - assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups, according to an official of the corps.
In the $40,000,000 budget that - has been submitted for Congressional approval, $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies.
Twelve projects - proposed by private groups are at the contract - negotiation stage, Gordon Boyce, director of relations with the voluntary agencies, said in a Washington interview.
Six of these were proposed by religious groups.
They will be for teaching, agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.
.
QUESTION RAISED.
Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods, means and goals.
There are a number of ways this could happen -, the churchmen pointed out, and here is an example : Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled.
When he protested, the hotel owner said : " Why do you worry ? The U. S. Government is paying for it.
The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers ".
.
MISSIONARY EXPLAINS.
" I do n't work for the Government ", the American said.
" I'm a missionary ".
The hotel owner shrugged.
" Same thing ", he said.
And then, some churchmen remarked, there is a more classical church - state problem : Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? R. Sargent Shriver Jr., director of the corps, is certain that they can.
No religious group, he declared in an interview -, will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes -.
MOSCOW, JUNE 18.
At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia, Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said, beaming : " Look, he took everything I had - " ! Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker.
Indonesia is one of the twenty under - developed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America that - are receiving Soviet aid.
The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc - are rapidly expanding their economic, technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations.
The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year, according to Western estimates.
This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under - developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954.
In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries.
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., JUNE 18.
A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations.
This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations.
One effect of the proposal, which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength, as in the past, would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India.
India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants.
The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations - made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report.
The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations.
.
FORMULA IS DUE THIS WEEK.
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected - to receive the report this week.
The jobs formula is understood - to follow these lines : <para>.
Each of the organization's ninety - nine members would get two professional posts, such as political affairs officer, a department head or an economist, to start.
.
<para>.
Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts.
.
<para>.
Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut - off point.
GENEVA, JUNE 18.
The three leaders of Laos agreed today - to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that - would unite the war - ridden kingdom.
The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum, Premier of the pro - Western royal Government; Prince Souvanna Phouma, leader of the nation's neutralists and - recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc, and Prince Souphanouvong, head of the pro - Communist Pathet Lao forces.
The latter two are half - brothers.
Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen - nation conference on the future of Laos.
An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task, diplomats conceded.
But no one was overly optimistic.
.
TACTICS STUDIED IN GENEVA.
W. Averell Harriman of the United States, Malcolm MacDonald of Britain, Maurice Couve de Murville, France's Foreign Minister, and Howard C. Green, Canada's Minister of External Affairs, concluded, meanwhile, a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference.
The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week.
Princess Moune, Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter, read the Princes' statement.
They had a two - hour luncheon together in " an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation ", she said.
The three Laotians agreed upon a six - point agenda for their talks, which are to last three days.
The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days.
.
TO DEAL WITH PRINCIPLES.
The meetings in Zurich, the statement said -, would deal only with principles that - would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government.

WASHINGTON.
Thousands of bleacher - type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20.
Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day, hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath - taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route.
Pennsylvania Avenue, - named for one of the original 13 states, perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint.
But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it.
.
MANY BUILDINGS.
Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings, plus shrines and monuments.
Of course, 1600 Pennsylvania, the White House, is the most famous address of the free world.
Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue, begins a series of great federal buildings, some a block long and all about seven - stories high.
Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue, - now about 169 years old.
In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women - parade.
They were the suffragettes and they wanted - to vote.
In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time.
.
SEATS ON SQUARE.
Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States - returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept.
Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation.
Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania, powered with lines that - are underground.
Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points - bordering Lafayette Square, opposite the White House.
In this historic square are several statutes, but the one that - stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans.
Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units.
About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade.
Division one of the parade will be the service academies.
Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas, the respective states of the President and of Vice - President L. B. Johnson.
Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union.
Division three will be headed by the Marines - followed by 12 states; division four will be headed by the Navy, - followed by 11 states; division five, by the Air Force - followed by 11 states.
Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard, - followed by the reserve forces of all services, five states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the trust territories and the Canal Zone.
JACKSON, MISS..
What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ? Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time, no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future.
This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants Gov. Ross Barnett.
Barnett, who came into office with no previous experience in public administration, has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps - his foes - - guessing but his friends as well.
Consequently, it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year.
.
COULD BE SCRAMBLE.
Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far.
The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job - seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight - year quest for the governor's office.
There are many who predict that should Barnett decide - to call the Legislature back into special session, it - will really throw his administration into a scramble.
Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together - Barnett will be able to enjoy a re - enactment of the strange but successful " honeymoon " he had - in the 1960 legislative session.
If Barnett does n't call a special session in 1961, it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session -.
The odds favor a special session, - more than likely early in the year.
.
DISTRICTS ISSUE.
Legislators always get restless for a special session (whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain) and if they start - agitating.
Barnett is not expected - to be able to withstand the pressure.
The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat.
With eyes focused on the third congressional district, the historic Delta district, and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely - to go, the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature.
Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961, with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House.
Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents, the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck.
And there has been no effort - since the election to pull it back together.
.
FUTURE CLOUDED.
Barnett, as the titular head of the Democratic party, apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement - - come from the loyalist ranks - to completely bypass him as a party functionary.
With a Democratic administration, party patronage - would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election.
Now, the picture is clouded, and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis, who remained loyal to the ticket, are uncertain of their status.
Reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen.
BATON ROUGE, LA..
The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears - to face a difficult year in 1961, with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.
The year - will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue.
But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue that of finances in state government.
The transition from segregation to finances - might already be in progress, in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent.
The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy, since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.
But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators - to suspect the tax bill was related more directly - to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation.
.
LEGISLATORS WEARY.
Indeed, the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat.
The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant - in - aid program.
The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies - revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two - thirds vote.
The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes.
Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy.
If it fails - to pass, he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration.
He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature.
Actually, Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway.
Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so - far losing battle to block token integration.
This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge - publicly.
They would like - to convey the notion something is being done, even though it is something they know - to be ineffectual.
.
UNDERLYING CONCERN.
Passage of the sales tax measure - would also give Davis the means to effect a transition.
He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle.
Then he could tell them - to go home, while the administration continued - to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in - over an eight months period.
It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million, since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one.
But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant - in - aid program, a not unlikely conclusion, it - could very well seek a way - to use the money for other purposes.
This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration the shortage of cash.
It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year.
If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill, or any other tax bill, it - could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma.
Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session, the administration will either have - to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.
.
CONSTANT PROBLEM.
In either case, it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser.
The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor.
It is one that most try - to avoid -, as - long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem.
But if all alternatives - should be clearly blocked off, it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature.
This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims - to exert pressure on the Legislature, so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.
A constant problem - confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried - to economize.
Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.
The new year might see some house - cleaning, either genuine or token, depending upon developments, to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms.
City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had " an inside track " with the city.
Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000.
.
<lsquo> SHORTCUTS <rsquo> UNNOTICED.
Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted - to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that - was far less than the " legitimate " bids of competing contractors.
The Hughes concern then took " shortcuts " on the project but got paid anyway, Hemphill said.
The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400 performance bond - covering the contract.
The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played - in reviewing the project.
The signature of Harold V. Varani, former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property, appeared on payment vouchers - certifying work on the project.
Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor.
Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed - to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter.
The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference - following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that - was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959.
.
CONCERN BANKRUPT.
The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries, Inc., - both of 3646 N. 2d st., filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law.
On Monday, the Hughes concern - was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization.
Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish, Jr.
.
INTERVENES IN CASE.
The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms, Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co.
At Berger's direction, the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there.
" I am taking the position that the contract - was clearly violated ", Berger said.
The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track.
The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints.
The city paid for work on 75, of which no more than 21 - were repaired, Hemphill charged.
.
WIDE RANGE IN BIDS.
Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted - to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint.
The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge, Mass., which listed the same officers as Hughes, was $600 per joint.
But, Hemphill added -, bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint.
Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference.
Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes company.
" We wo n't know the full amount until we get a full report ", Wagner said.
" We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond ", Berger said.
Wagner replied, " Ca n't you just see the headline : <lsquo> City Hooked for $172,000 <rsquo> " ?.
<lsquo> KNOW ENOUGH TO SUE <rsquo>.
Berger insisted that " we know enough to sue for the full amount ".
Douglas M. Pratt, president of the PTC, who attended the meeting, said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El.
" We want - to find out who knew about it ", Pratt said.
" Certain people must have known about it ".
" The PTC is investigating the whole matter ", Pratt said.
Samuel D. Goodis, - representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association, objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees, saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year.
Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee.
For hotels with 1000 rooms, the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year, Goodis said.
.
TESTIFIES AT HEARING.
His testimony came during a hearing on a bill - raising fees for a wide variety of licenses, permits and city services.
The new fees are expected - to raise an additional $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year after that.
The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses, hotels and multi - family dwellings to $5 a room.
The cost of a license now is $2, with an annual renewal fee of $1.
Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels.
.
REVENUE ESTIMATED.
The city expects the higher rooming house, hotel and apartment house fees - to bring in an additional $457,000 a year.
The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan, spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia, on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses.
A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer, who formerly raised pedigreed dogs.
The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog.
.
COMMISSIONER REPLIES.
Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care.
In reply, Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees.
He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 to the Women's S.P.C.A.; $15,000 to pay six policemen - assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites.
.
BACKS HIGHER FEES.
City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed the higher fees, which, he said, - had been under study for more than a year.
The city - is not adequately compensated for the services - covered by the fees, he said.
The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis.
Petitions - asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday, it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A. Davenport, counsel for the widow of the man - killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard's hit - run car.
The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower, Davenport said.
Barnard, who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit - run charges, was fined $500 by Judge Warren K. Hess, and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time.
He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning.
Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery, 39.
His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation.
The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project.
The commission also approved a novel plan that - would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project.
One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865 The tract is bounded by Island ave., Dicks ave., 61st st., and Eastwick ave.
.
FOUR PARKS PLANNED.
It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses, garden apartments, four small parks, schools, churches, a shopping center and several small clusters of stores.
The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm, a Philadelphia builder, for work in the project.
The second agreement permits the authority - to sell a 520 - acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp., a firm - composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders, which is interested in developing part of the project.
.
WOULD BAR VEHICLES.
The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis, former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp.
The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic.
It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that - - would eventually run through the center of the entire two - and - a - half - mile length of the project.
The esplanade eliminates Grovers ave., which on original plans ran through the center of the development.
The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project.
KANSAS CITY, MO., FEB. 9 (UPI).
The president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters - was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work.
Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden, 42, the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union, suffered multiple fractures of both ankles.
He was in Baptist Memorial hospital.
.
IGNITION SETS OFF BLAST.
The battalion chief said he - had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work.
" I -'d just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway ", he said.
Gladden's wife and two of his sons, John, 17, and Jim, 13, were inside the house.
The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall.

Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed - to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president.

The army leaders threatened - to form a new military government if the parties failed - to sign an eight point protocol - agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president.
Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months.

Helping foreign countries - to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically, E. M. Martin, assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night.
Martin, who has been in office in Washington, D. C., for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel.
He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries - build their own societies their own ways, following their own paths.
" We must persuade them - to enjoy a way of life which, if not identical, is congenial with ours ", he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want - it will lack ritiuality and loyalty.
.
PATIENCE NEEDED.
Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice, he said -, was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union.
He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in, and added, " so - long as people rebel, we must not give up ".
Martin called for patience on the part of Americans.
" The countries are trying - to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build - ", he said.
By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare, he said.
.
INDIVIDUAL HELP BEST.
" We have no reason to fear failure, but we must be extraordinarily patient ", the assistant secretary said.
Economically, Martin said -, the United States - could best help foreign countries by helping them - help themselves.
Private business is more effective than government aid -, he explained, because individuals are able to work with the people themselves.
The United States must plan - to absorb the exported goods of the country, at what he termed a " social cost ".
Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country.
The Portland school board was asked Monday - to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack.
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go, and whose advice it should follow.
The board members, after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar, 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr., said they thought they - had already been cooperating.
Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem, in case of atomic attack, but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them - to go -.
Dr. Melvin W. Barnes, superintendent, said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership, perhaps on the national level, to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would " be more fruitful ", and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along - in their planning as this district.
" Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster ", he said.
" Nobody really expects - to evacuate.
I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that - would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following.
Mrs. Molvar, who kept reiterating her request that they " please take a stand ", said, " We must have faith in somebody on the local level, and it would n't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children ".
Dr. Barnes said that there seemed - to be feeling that evacuation plans, even for a high school where there were lots of cars " might not be realistic and would not work ".
Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program.
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting.
It - was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done, is going to be done and what it thought - should be done.

A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God, - in session at the Memorial Coliseum.
The council revised, in an effort to strengthen, the denomination's 16 basic beliefs - adopted in 1966.
The changes, - unanimously adopted, were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible.
The council agreed it - should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on - the Bible.
At the adoption, the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman, general superintendent, commented, " The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has, without compromise, stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives ".
.
NEW POINT ADDED.
Many changes involved minor editing and clarification; however, the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list.
The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination, now reads : " The scriptures, both Old and New Testament, - are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct ".
The third belief, in six points, emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ, and : emphasizes the Virgin birth the sinless life of Christ His miracles His substitutionary work on the cross His bodily resurrection from the dead and His exaltation to the right hand of God.
.
SUPER AGAIN ELECTED.
Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two - year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God.
His offices are in Springfield, Mo.
Election came on the nominating ballot.
Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program, " Breakthrough " - scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years.
In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman, urged the delegates - to consider a 10 - year expansion program, with " Breakthrough " the theme for the first two years.
The Rev. R. L. Brandt, national secretary of the home missions department, stressed the need for the first two years' work.
" Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church.
This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life ", he told delegates Friday.
.
CHURCH LOSES PACE.
Talking of the rapid population growth (upwards of 12,000 babies born daily) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1<frac12> minutes, he said " our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge ".
" In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches ", the Rev. Mr. Brandt said, adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons.
" In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois, where we have 200; 800 in Southern New England, we have 60; we need 100 in Rhode Island, we have none ", he said.
To step up the denomination's program, the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years.
To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods, he said.
.
<lsquo> CHURCH MEETS CHANGE <rsquo>.
" The church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour ".
A capsule view of proposed plans includes : Encouraging by every means, all existing Assemblies of God churches - to start new churches.
Engaging mature, experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers.
Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers (laymen, who will be urged - to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project).
Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6 - 12 months as apprentices in well - established churches.
U.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions - made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial.
Denials were of motions of dismissal, continuance, mistrial, separate trial, acquittal, striking of testimony and directed verdict.
In denying motions for dismissal, Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that " a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are ".
Attorney Dwight L. Schwab, in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein, argued there is no evidence - linking Weinstein to the conspiracy, but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide.
.
PROOF LACK CHARGED.
Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud, to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied : " It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy, and the mails - were then used to carry it out ".
In the afternoon, defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements, some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case.
MIAMI, FLA., MARCH 17.
The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major - League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision, this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3.
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draought as they coasted along with a 3 - to - 0 advantage.
.
SIEBERN HITS HOMER.
Over the first five frames, Jack Fisher, the big righthandler who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant, held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits.
Then Dick Hyde, submarine - ball hurler, entered the contest and only five batters needed - to face him before there existed a 3 - to - 3 deadlock.
A two - run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game, and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts.
.
HOUSE THROWS WILD.
With one down in the eighth, Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle.
Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt.
Then Heywood Sullivan, Kansas City catcher, singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run.
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser, a wild pitch, and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center.
The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion, gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers.
Three were doubles, Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one.
.
HARTMAN IMPRESSIVE.
Bill Kunkel, Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club - down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium.
The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth.
Hartman, - purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall, allowed no hits in his scoreless three - inning appearance, and merited the triumph.
Keegan, a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder, gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames, escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed - to tally.
.
ROBINSON DOUBLES AGAIN.
In the ninth, Robinson led off with his second double of the night, a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left.
Whitey Herzog, - performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring, worked Keegan for a base on balls.
Then three consecutive pinch - hitters failed - to produce.
Pete Ward was sent in for House and, after failing in a bunt attempt, popped to Howser on the grass back of short.
John Powell, - batting for Adair, fanned after fouling off two 2 - and - 2 pitches, and Buddy Barker, - up for Stepanovich, bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2 - hour - and - 27 - minute contest.
The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding, along with Robinson, the two Birds who got a pair of hits, doubled to right center, moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate.
The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out.
Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally.
.
LUMPE ERRS.
Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single, and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error.
Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners.
When Robinson tried - to stretch his blow into a triple, he was cut down in a close play at third, Tuttle to Andy Carey.
The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center.
.
CAREY SINGLES.
Carey singled on a slow - bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first.
It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit.
Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play.
Breeding to Adair to Gentile, setting up Tuttle's 390 - foot homer over the wall in left center.
If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days, it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees, who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon.
MIAMI, FLA., MARCH 17.
The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training.
Hansen, who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a.255 freshman average, completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players.
The big, 22 - year - old shortstop, the 1960 American league " rookie - of - the year ", flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore, signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5 - to - 3 loss to Kansas City the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row.
.
15 POUNDS LIGHTER.
The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds, 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring.
He hopes - to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence.
When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox, Ky., Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 " too light for me to be at my best " he said.
" I feel good physically ", Hansen added -, " but I think I'll move better carrying a little less - weight than I'm carrying now ".
.
SEEKS " IMPROVED FIELDING ".
The rangy, Albany (Cal.) native, a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz, set " improved fielding " as his 1961 goal.
" I think I can do a better job with the glove, now that I know the hitters around the league a little better ", he said.
Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two - game weekend series with the New York Yankees.
Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm, the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists, are slated - to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.M. contest.
.
DUREN, SHELDON ON HILL.
Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon, a rookie righthander who posted a 15 - 1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn (N.Y.) farm club of the Class - D New York - Pennsylvania League, are the probable rival pitchers.

.
SQUAD CUT NEAR.
Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course, also at Fort Knox, Ky.
The 22 - year - old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen.
Baltimore's bulky spring - training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek - to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit.
.
<crule3>.
" Take a ride on this one ", Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat, headed for the plate and bounced a third - inning two - run double off the left - centerfield wall tonight.
It was the first of two doubles by Robinson, who was in a mood to celebrate.
Just before game time, Robinson's pretty wife, Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer.
Unfortunately, Brooks' teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven - hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers.
.
<crule3>.
Hansen arrived just before nightfall, two hours late, in company with Lee MacPhail; J. A. W. Iglehart, chairman of the Oriole board of directors, and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn.
Their flight was delayed -, Dunn said, when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane.

AUSTIN, TEXAS.
A Texas halfback who - does n't even know the team's plays, Eldon Moritz, ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games.
Time stands still every time Moritz, a 26 - year - old Army Signal Corps veteran, goes into the field.
Although he never gets to play while the clock is running, he gets a big kick several every Saturday, in fact out of football.
Moritz - does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that - - will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl.
That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries.
He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41 - 8 slaughter of Washington State.
Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback, the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team.
But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response, " place - kicker ".
A 208 - pound, 6 - foot 1 - inch senior from Stamford, Moritz practices nothing but place - kicking.
Last year, when he worked out at halfback all season, he did n't get into a single game.
" This year, coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place - kicking he thought he could use me ", said Moritz.
" So I started - practicing on it in spring training.
Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right (kicking) leg and, as a result, several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough.
Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and, as a result, he hopes - to start - practicing field goals this week.
He kicked several - while playing at Stamford High School, including one that - beat Anson, 3 - 0, in a 1953 district game.
" I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school ", he said -, " and made 26 in a row at one time.
I never did miss one in a playoff game I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years ".
Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury.
He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee, then played 77 minutes in 1956.
His statistical record that year, when Texas won only one game and lost nine, was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards, punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards.
He went into the Army in March, 1957, and returned two years later.
But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season.
Place kicking is largely a matter of timing, Moritz declared.
" Once you get the feel of it, there's not much to it.
I've tried - to teach some of the other boys - to kick and some of them ca n't seem - to get the feel.
Practice helps you - to get your timing down.
" It's kind of like golf if you do n't swing a club very often, your timing gets off ".
Moritz, however, kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session.
" If you kick too much, your leg gets kinda dead ", he explained.

FOOTNOTES :.
In their first three games, the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times, or 40 per cent... their total passing yardage in three games, - 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts, is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959, when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries....
Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season, when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games....
Saxton has made only one second - half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game, for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards, gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56 - yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench....
Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma....
Last week, when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing, he said : " That wo n't last long ".
It did n't; Monday, he had four Longhorns in the top four....
A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday, but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University.
The Mustangs do n't play this week.
" We're just real happy for the players ", Coach Bill Meek said of the 9 - 7 victory over the Air Force Academy.
" I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on.
It was the first time we've been ahead - this season (when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal) ".
Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as " a good feeling, I think, on the part of the coaches and the players.
We needed it and we got it ".
Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon.
Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game.
" Nelson played magnificent football ", Meek praised.
" He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times.
And he caused the fumble that - set up our touchdown.
He broke that boy (Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff) in two and knocked him loose from the football ".
Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages.
One was on a fourth - down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory.
" As soon as it started to form, Gannon spotted it ", Meek said.
" He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy (halfback Terry Isaacson) had time to turn around.
He really crucified him... he nailed it for a yard loss ".
The Air Force's, and the game's, final play, was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards.
" He just lay back there and waited for it ", Meek said.
" He almost brought it back all the way ".
Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice, Meek expects the squad - to be physically sound for Rice.
" Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game ", Meek said.
" He'll be out of action all this week.
He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game.
There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee ".
Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland.
" He's looking a lot better, and he's able to run ", Meek explained.
" We'll let him - do a lot of running this week, but I do n't know if he'll be able to play ".
The game players saw the Air Force film Monday, ran for 30 minutes, then went in, while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes.
" We'll work hard Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday ", Meek said -, " and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday.
We'll work out about an hour on Saturday, then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week, then taper off ".
SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday, Oct. 21.

HUDDLE HEARSAY.
Held out of Texas Tech's sweat - suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford, who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury - suffered in the Raiders' 38 - 7 loss to Texas A&M... Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday, Baylor worked out in the rain Monday mud or no mud... End Gene Raesz, who broke a hand in the Owl's game with LSU, was back working out with Rice Monday, and John Nichols, sophomore guard, moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury... The Texas Aggies got a day off - Monday a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night, but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett, - shaken up in the Tech game, would not play against Trinity Saturday... Halfback Bud Priddy, - slowed for almost a month by a slowly - mending sprained ankle, joined TCU's workout Monday.
The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts a 19 - 12 triumph over the Denver Broncos but their visit will be a short one.
The Texans have two more road games at Buffalo and Houston before they play for the home folks again, and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected - to be - in pre - season reckonings.
Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey, who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks, apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex - National Football Leaguers, M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb.
Rabb, the former Louisiana State field general, came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22 - 12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers, defending league champions.
" Just our luck " ! exclaimed Stram.
" Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way ".
Ramsey - has a thing or two to mutter about - himself, for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver, and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star, Jack Spikes, though he did the team's place - kicking while nursing a knee injury.
" Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well ", said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game.
" In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job ".
The Texans won the game through ball control, with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes.
" We always like - to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack ", explained Stram.
" They can be going along, doing little damage, then bang, bang they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble ".
The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans, but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off.
The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes, the flashy halfback.
He was called upon - 26 times more than all of the other ball - carriers - combined and delivered 145 yards.
The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson, the speedy halfback, hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas.
A quick touchdown resulted.
" That permitted us - to start controlling the ball right away ", said Stram, quipping, " I think I'll put that play in the book ".
The early Southwest Conference football leaders Texas, Arkansas and Texas A&M made a big dent in the statistics last week.
Texas' 545 - yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1,512 yards (1,065 rushing and 447 passing) a new SWC high.
Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing (on 5 completions in 7 tosses) and a tough defense to whip TCU, and A&M, with a 38 - point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950.
Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards, the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards.
Texas leads in per - game rushing averages, 355 yards, and passing 149 (to Baylor's 126), but idle Baylor has the best defensive record (187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189).
A&M has the best defense against passes, 34.7 yards per game.
Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs - currently in use, the major leagues have ordered their own tests, which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis, 5 - 3.
The husky 6 - 3, 205 - pound lefthander, was in command all the way before an on - the - scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area.
It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight.
They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack.
Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning.
He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings, an unusual characteristic for a southpaw.
The Bears took the lead in the first inning, as they did in Sunday's opener, and never lagged.
Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack.
After Al Paschal gruonded out, Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe.
Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left.
Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout.
The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner, Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer's glove.
Nischwitz was working on a 3 - hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth.
Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner, Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infielder roller accounted for the tallies.
The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert.
Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth.
Despite the 45 - degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48, thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play.
Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base.
.
BINGLES AND BOBBLES :.
Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits... It was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order... The infield - was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark... Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ... Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer, Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage.
... Lefty Wyman Carey, another Denver rookie, will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night... Ed Donnelly - is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn.
DALLAS, TEX., MAY 1 (AP).
Kenny Lane of Muskegon, Mich., world's seventh ranked lightweight, had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler, Tex., here Monday night.
ST. PAUL - MINNEAPOLIS, MAY 1 (AP).
Billy Gardner's line double, which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field, drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6 - 5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday.
Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game, a liner to center.
He came all the way around on Gardner's hit before 5777 fans.
It was Gardner's second run - batted in of the game and his only ones of the year.
Turk Lown was tagged with the loss, his second against no victories, while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss.
The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left.
The White Sox had taken a 5 - 4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon a walk and a sacrifice fly.
Jim Landis' 380 - foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1 - 0 lead, but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard.
Al Smith's 340 - blast over left in the fourth his fourth homer of the campaign tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front.
A double by Green, Allison's run - scoring 2 - baser, an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth.
OGDEN, UTAH, MAY 1 (AP).
Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball.
" I've had it ", he told a newsman.
" I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club ".
This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout.
Jensen got only six hits in 46 at - bats for a.130 batting average in the first 12 games.
He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday, without an official word to anybody, and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno, Nev., where his wife, former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen, awaited.
She said, when she learned Jackie was heading home : " I -'m just speculating, but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances ".
The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner, City of San Francisco, stopped in Ogden, Utah, for a few minutes.
Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him.
The conductor said to Ritchie : " I do n't think you want - to talk to him.
You -'ll probably get a ball bat on the head.
He's mad at the world ".
But Jackie had gone into the station.
Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand.
" I told him who I was and he was quite cold.
But he warmed up after a while.
I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double - crosser and said anything he (Liston) got - was through a keyhole.
He said he - had never talked to Liston ".
Liston is Bill Liston, baseball writer for the Boston Traveler, who quoted Jensen as saying : " I ca n't hit anymore.
I ca n't run.
I ca n't throw.
Suddenly my reflexes are gone.
JUST WHEN IT SEEMS baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging.
And so it was over the weekend what with 40 - year - old Warren Spahn pitching his no - hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record - tying 4 - homer spree Sunday.
Both, of course, were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime.
Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts.
It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know - who have moved past the 2 - score - year milestone.
And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked, " Wish I was 40, and a top - grade big leaguer.
.
<crule4>.
THE MODEST AND HAPPY Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days.
But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all - time great lefthanders in the game's history.
Yes, with Bob Grove, Carl Hubbell, Herb Pennock, Art Nehf, Vernon Gomez, et al.
Spahn not only is - a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow, a ball player's ball player, as they say in the trade.
I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14, 1951, before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792.
.
<crule4>.
" SPAHNIE DOES N'T KNOW how - to merely go through the motions ", remarked Enos Slaughter, another all-out guy, who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse.
The spectacular Mays, who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25, joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings.
Incidentally, only two did it before a home audience.
Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field.
Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies, the Braves' Joe Adcock, Lou Gehrig of the Yankees, Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito, - then with Cleveland, made their history on the road.

WILLIE'S BIG DAY REVIVED the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle.
This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion, - depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro - Yankee.
The record books, however, would favor the Giants' ace.
In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases.
Once the figure was 30 - 30.
Willie's lifetime batting average of.318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's.
The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park.
It - will forever be a baseball mystery how a team - will suddenly start - hitting after a distressing slump.
.
<crule4>.
THE DENVER - AREA TV audience was privileged - to see Mays' four home runs, thanks to a new arrangement - made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home.
This rule - providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers.
The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the " Living Room Athletic Club " when games were cut off.
Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy.
This year, I am told -, the CBS network will continue - to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here.
There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise.
It is an irritable rule that - does baseball more - harm than good, especially at the minor league level.
You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy.
This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game.
CINCINNATI, OHIO (AP).
The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5 - game romp over outclassed Cincinnati, crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13 - 5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale.
With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries, the American League champs still mounted a 15 - hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers, the most - ever used by one team in a series game.
Johnny Blanchard, Mantle's replacement, slammed a 2 - run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5 - run first inning.
Hector Lopez, - subbing for Berra, smashed a 3 - run homer off Bill Henry during another 5 - run explosion in the fourth.
The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors.
The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud.
In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center, about 400 feet away, with two men on.
Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game, trailing only 6 - 3, but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out.
In the fifth, Wally Post slashed a 2 - run homer off Bud Daley, but by that time the score was 11 - 5 and it really did n't matter.
The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager.
Only Bucky Harris, the " boy - manager " of Washington in 1924, and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat.
PHILADELPHIA, JAN. 23.
Nick Skorich, the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles, was elevated today to head coach.
Skorich received a three - year contract at a salary - believed - to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year.
He succeeds Buck Shaw, who retired at the end of last season.
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer.
Williams is a defensive coach.
Gauer works with the ends.
.
CHOICE WAS EXPECTED.
The selection had been expected.
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings, the newest National Football League entry.
Van Brocklin, the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title, was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday.
Philadelphia permitted him - to seek a better connection after he had refused - to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player.
With Skorich at the helm, the Eagles are expected - to put more emphasis on running, rather than passing.
In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials.
Skorich, however, is a strong advocate of a balanced attack - split between running and passing.
.
COACH PLAYED 3 YEARS.
Skorich, who is 39 years old, played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three - year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
An injury forced Skorich - to quit after the 1948 season.
He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949.
He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N. Y.
He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach.
Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers.
The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959.
Skorich began his new job auspiciously today.
At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth, the Eagles were honored for winning the championship.
Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players, coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks - shaped like a football.
With the announcement of a " special achievement award " to William A. (Bill) Shea, the awards list - was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty - eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter, Baseball Writers' Association of America, at the Waldorf - Astoria Hotel.
Shea, the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee, will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn, the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves; Frank Graham, the Journal - American sports columnist; Bill Mazeroski, the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Casey Stengel, the former manager of the Yankees.
Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award.
Mazeroski, whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game, will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series.
Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award.
To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year.
.
SHOW FOLLOWS CEREMONIES.
A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies, which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit, dance and song.
The 53 - year - old Shea, a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background, - is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York.
Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that - included James A. Farley, Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume, Shea worked relentlessly.
His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city.
The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees.
Despite countless barriers and disappointments, Shea moved forward.
When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion, he sought - to convince another National League club - to move here.
When that failed, he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league, the Continental, with New York as the key franchise.
The Continental League never got off the ground, but after two years it forced the existing majors - to expand.
.
FLUSHING STADIUM IN WORKS.
The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson.
A big - league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works, and once the lease is signed the local club - will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick.
Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium.
Shea and his wife, Nori, make their home at Sands Point, L. I.
Bill Jr., 20; Kathy, 15, and Patricia, 9, round out the Shea family.
Shea was born in Manhattan.
He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington.
He played basketball there while working toward a law degree.
Later, Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians, a minor league professional football team.
He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League.
.
.
All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday.
On Friday, Roger Maris, the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most - valuable - player award, will meet with Roy Hamey, the general manager.
Maris is in line for a big raise.
Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those - honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight.
The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre.
Palmer, golf's leading money - winner in 1960, and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin.
Deane Beman, the National Amateur champion, and all the metropolitan district champions, including Bob Gardner, the amateur title - holder, also will receive awards.
The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield, N. J., and Palm Beach, Fla., for his sponsorship of charity tournaments.
Horton Smith of Detroit, a former president of the Professional Golfers Association, will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback - following a recent illness.
The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri.
.
GOLF'S GOLDEN BOY.
ARNOLD PALMER has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months.
He won the Masters, the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money.
He was heralded as " Sportsman of the Year " by Sports - Illustrated, and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the " Professional Athlete of the Year ", a distinction that - earned for him the $10,000 diamond - studded Hickok Belt.
But he also achieved something that - endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot.
A couple of weeks ago, he scored a monstrous 12 on a par - 5 hole.
It made him human.
And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair.
If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege, there was hope - left for all.
It - was neither a spirit of self - sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that - motivated Arnold.
He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that - respects no one and aggravates all.
The world's best golfer, shooting below par, came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher.
He boomed a 280 - yard drive.
Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance.
.
NO MARGIN FOR ERROR.
On the narrow fairway of a 508 - yard hole, Arnold whipped into his second shot.
The ball went off in a majestic arc, an out-of - bounds slice.
He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds.
He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side.
" It is possible that I over - corrected ", he said ruefully.
Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes.
So he wound up with a dozen.
" It was a nice round figure, that 12 ", he said as he headed for the clubhouse, not too much perturbed.
From the standpoint of the army of duffers, however, this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had - since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open.
The idol of the hackers, of course, is Ray Ainsley, who achieved a 19 in the United States Open.
Their secondary hero is another pro, Willie Chisholm, who drank his lunch during another Open and tried - to blast his way out of a rock - strewn gully.
Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes, who tried - to keep count.
.
STICKLER FOR RULES.
" How many is that, Jim " ? asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project.
" Thirteen ", said Long Jim.
" Nae, man ", said Willie -, " ye must be countin' the echoes ".
He had a 16.
Palmer's dozen - were honestly earned.
Nor were there any rules to save him.
If there had been, he would have found a loophole, because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book.
This knowledge has come in handy, too.
His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that - flowed along the right side of the fairway.
The ball floated downstream.
A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy, who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie.
Arnold sent for Joe Dey, the executive secretary of the golf association.
Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it - had originally entered the stream.
" I knew it all along ", confessed Arnold - with a grin, " but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there ".
For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity, Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings.
Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors.
He -'ll even bull head - on into the rules when he is sure he's right.
That's how he first won the Masters in 1958.
It happened on the twelfth hole, a 155 - yarder.
Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker - guarding the green, an embankment that - had become soft and spongy from the rains, thereby bringing local rules into force.
.
RULING FROM ON HIGH.
" I can remove the ball, ca n't I " ? asked Palmer of an official.
" No ", said the official.
" You must play it where it lies ".
" You're wrong ", said Arnold, a man who knows the rules.
" I'll do as you say, but I -'ll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling ".
He scored a 4 for the embedded ball, a 3 with the provisional one.
The golfing fathers ruled in his favor.
So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke.
Until a few weeks ago, however, Arnold Palmer was some god - like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers.
But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys, a bigger hero than he ever had been before.
A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today.
Other items on the agenda during the meetings, which are expected - to continue through Saturday, concern television, rules changes, professional football's hall of fame, players' benefits and constitutional amendments.
The owners would like each club in the fourteen - team league - to play a home - and - home series with teams in its division, plus two games against teams in the other division.
However, this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks.
Pete Rozelle, the league commissioner, pointed out : " We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other ".
Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early - season conflict in dates.
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay - offs - effective at 12.01 A.M. next Saturday.
The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000.
Howard E. Simpson, the railroad's president, said, " A drastic decline in freight loading - due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action ".
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates.
.
SALARY CUT AND LAY - OFFS.
It will be accomplished in two ways : 1..
A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers, supervisors and other employees - not belonging to unions.
There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class.
2..
Sufficient lay - offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense.
Since the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract, it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough, a B.&O. spokesman said.
Those union members - kept on their jobs, therefore, will not take a cut in their wages.
The spokesman said the number - to be furloughed can not be estimated since the lay - offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men - are most needed on the job.
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount streets.
The victim, Norman B. Wiley, 38, of the 900 block North Charles street, was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery.
The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money.
The victim was beaten when he attempted - to stop the bandit.
He said the assailant, who was armed with a.45 - caliber automatic, entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue and Gold street.
In another attack, Samuel Verstandig, 41, proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street, told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him.
A baby was burned to death and two other children - were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one - room Anne Arundel county home.
The victim Darnell Somerville, Negro, 1, was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis.
His sister and brother, Marie Louise, 3, and John Raymond, Jr. 22 months, were admitted to the hospital.
The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body.
.
BOY IN FAIR CONDITION.
The boy received second - degree burns of the face, neck and back.
His condition was reported - to be fair.
Police said the children's mother, Mrs. Eleanor Somerville, was visiting next door when the fire occurred.
The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park, at Jones Station, police said.
ANNAPOLIS, JAN. 7.
The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what.
The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams, Jr., a board member and long - time critic of the superintendent, argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting.
The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes - presented at the following meeting.
.
CITES DISCREPANCIES.
Mrs. Williams had a list which she said - contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval.
" I hate - to have these things - come up again and again ", Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion.
" These are the board's minutes.
I'll write what you tell me - to - ".
For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago.
It was about that time -, a board member said later, that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen, Jr., State superintendent of schools, told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials - that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him.
The Board of County Commissioners, the Sanitary Commission, the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings.
Dr. Jenkins notes, however, that most of the school boards in the State do not do so.
State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli (D., First Baltimore) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt street.
He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal ambulance.
Doctors at the hospital said he - was partially paralyzed on the right side.
His condition was said - to be, " fair ".
Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt street.
.
BARBER SUMMONED.
He called Vincent L. Piraro, proprietor of the shop, who summoned police and an ambulance.
The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are " deficiencies " in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible.
Councilman William D. Schaefer (D., Fifth) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month.
.
WERNER CRITICIZED.
Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm, Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said - should be made in the snow plan here.
He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December.
Equipment should be in operation " almost immediately after the first snowfall ", Mr. Schaefer said.
The Councilman, who is the Administration floor leader, also criticized Bernard L. Werner, public works director, for " halting snow operations " on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm.
.
SENT HOME FOR REST.
Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week.
What he did, Mr. Werner said -, was let manual laborers - go home Tuesday night for some rest.
Work resumed Wednesday, he said.
Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan, under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required - to use snow tires or chains on them, - should be " strictly enforced ".
Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority, the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas " not be overlooked... if our small merchants are to survive ".
Recounting personal observations of clearance work, the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes.
ANNAPOLIS, JAN. 7 (SPECIAL).
The 15 - year - old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife, who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay - front home, has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention.
The victims were H. Malone Dresbach, 47, and his wife, Shirley, 46.
Each had been shot in the back several times with a.22 - caliber automatic rifle, according to Capt. Elmer Hagner, chief of Anne Arundel detectives.
Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order - remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail.
The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court.
.
YOUNGER SON CALLS POLICE.
Soon after 10 A.M., when police reached the 1<frac12> - story brick home in the Franklin Manor section, 15 miles south of here on the bay, in response to a call from the Dresbach's other son, Lee, 14, they found Mrs. Dresbach's body on the first - floor bedroom floor.
Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor, police said.
The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car.
The description of the car - was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio.
.
TWO BROTHERS ADOPTED.
Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs.
Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car, with three boys, at a Route 2 service station, just outside Annapolis.
The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station, police said.
ANNAPOLIS, JAN. 7.
Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins, his administrative assistant, as Maryland's Secretary of State.
Mr. Simpkins will move into the post - being vacated by Thomas B. Finan, - earlier named attorney general to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert, who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of Appeals.
Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing - in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday.
.
SIMPKINS FROM SOMERSET.
Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county, and he and the Governor, - also a Somerset countian, have been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child.
Now 38, Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947.
Five years later, he was awarded the university's degree in law.
Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958.
From the outset of his first term, he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates.
MARYLAND contracts for future construction during October totaled $77,389,000, - up 10 per cent compared to October, 1960, F. W. Dodge, Dodge Corporation, reported.
Dodge reported the following breakdown : Nonresidential at $20,447,000, down 28 per cent; residential at $47,101,000, up 100 per cent; and heavy engineering at $9,841,000, down 45 per cent.
The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000, - a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year.
A breakdown of the ten - month total showed : Nonresidential at $253,355,000, up 22 per cent; residential at $278,877,000, up 12 per cent; and heavy engineering at $102,285,000, down 33 per cent.
Residential building consists of houses, apartments, hotels, dormitories and other buildings - designed for shelter.
The share of the new housing market - enjoyed by apartments, which began about six years ago, - has more than tripled within that span of time.
In 1961, it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction.
While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction, the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that - have encouraged builders - to concentrate in the apartment - building field.
Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those - now choosing apartments, Leo J. Pantas, vice president of a hardware manufacturing company, pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem - to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems - involved in maintaining a house.
.
CONVENIENCE HELD KEY.
" Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today.
Trouble - free, long - life, quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 ", Pantas predicted.
SIXTY - SEVEN living units are being added to the 165 - unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section.
Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units, in two - story and three - story structures.
Various of the apartments are of the terrace type, being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct.
Others, which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs, have balconies.
The structures - housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction.
Heating is by individual gas - fired, forced warm air systems.
CONSTRUCTION in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product, according to a study by Johns - Manville Corporation.
LONDON, FEB. 9.
Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine, the Dreadnought, and, by implication, of the entire United States navy's still - building nuclear sub fleet, were stolen by a London - based soviet spy ring, secret service agents testified today.
The Dreadnought was built on designs - supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year.
It is a killer sub that is, a hunter of enemy subs.
It has a hull - patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus, the world's first atomic submarine.
Its power unit, however, was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack.
.
FIVE HELD FOR TRIAL.
The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow st. police court here at the end of a three day hearing.
A full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants, Miss Ethel Gee, 46, and her newly devoted friend, Harry Houghton, 55, and divorced.
They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard.
Gordon A. Lonsdale, 37, a mystery man - presumed - to be Russian altho he carries a Canadian passport.
When arrested, he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti - submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping, it was testified.
.
FLASHED TO MOSCOW.
A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger, bookseller, and wife, Joyce.
[ <bital> In Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen, an American couple - formerly of New York City <eital>.
] In their suburban cottage the crown charges -, the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man, usually on the first Saturday evening of each month, and spent much of the week - end getting the secrets off to Moscow, either on a powerful transmitter - buried under the kitchen floor or as dots - posted over period marks in used books.
Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing, a printed page, or a manuscript.
All five pleaded innocent.
Only Miss Gee asked for bail.
Her young British lawyer, James Dunlop, pleaded that she - was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother, 80, her maiden aunt, - also 80 and bedridden for 20 years, and her uncle, 76, who once ran a candy shop.
.
REFUSES TO GRANT BAIL.
" I am not - prepared - to grant bail to any of them ", said the magistrate, K. J. P. Baraclough.
The trial will be held, probably the first week of March, in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs, the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s, was sentenced to 14 years in prison.
Fourteen years is the maximum penalty - now faced by the new five, who may have altered history in the 1960s.
Fuchs, after nine and a half years, was released, being given time off for good behavior.
He promptly went to communist East Germany.
The magistrate tonight refused - to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency, mostly $20 bills, and in British government bonds and stocks.
" This is Russian money ", said Mervin Griffith - Jones for the attorney general's office.
He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow, Lonsdale the Red paymaster, and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets.
.
" OF HIGHEST VALUE ".
The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought, and thereby of the American undersea fleet, were involved in the spy case had been hinted at - earlier.
But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare, Capt. George Symonds.
He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found - reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film - taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon, Jan. 7.
The information, he said -, would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy.
.
COURT CLEARED.
Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring, - watched for six months, was broken remained untold.
The British defending lawyers, who today increased from three to four, demanded - to know if they could make the information - involved - seem of little value to a jury, the chances of their clients would improve.
So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain - to elaborate for almost an hour.
Almost any information about the Dreadnought - would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet.
Britain began - designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided - to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that - had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed.
The United States offered - to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that - used in the Skipjack.
With the machinery went a complete design for the hull.
The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub, - much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it.
.
NAVY'S FUTURE INVOLVED.
" Much of the navy's future depends upon her ", an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August, 1959, for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station.
It - was there that the two accused civil servants were at work -.
" Her basic hull form [ a teardrop ] and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines, including the potent Polaris missile submarines ", the statement went on.
The atom reactor, water cooled, was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp.
Thru development, the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size, and also in complexity, allowing a single propeller - to be used, the navy said.
The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work.
It - was first tried out on a conventional submarine, the Albacore, in 1954.
The Skipjack became the fastest submarine - ever built.
Reputedly it could outrun, underwater, the fastest destroyers.
It - could, reputedly, go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month.
It was of the hunter - killer type, - designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advance gear and destroy them with torpedoes.
The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions - found in Miss Gee's purse would, if completed and handed back, have given the Kremlin a complete picture " of our current anti - submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future ".
.
INTERESTED IN DETECTOR.
The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC, the underwater equipment for detecting submarines, it was testified.
Range was a vital detail.
Designs of parts were sought.
Six radiomen told how, twice on two days after the ring was nabbed, a transmitter near Moscow was heard - calling, - using signals, times and wavelengths - specified on codes - found - hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid.
Oddly, the calls - were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested.
The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives " is the product of rumor, - combined with malice, and individual enmity " on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court.
The three Miles J. Cooperman, Sheldon Teller, and Richard Austin and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws.
In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men, Bernard H. Sokol, attorney for the detectives, said that evidence would show that his clients were " entirely innocent ".
.
<lsquo> HAD TO KNOW PEDDLERS <rsquo>.
" When they became members of the city police narcotics unit ", Sokol said -, " they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket.
They, on occasion, posed as addicts and peddlers ".
Altho federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together, Sokol continued -, rivalries developed when they were " aiming at the same criminals ".
This, he added -, brought about " petty jealousies " and " petty personal grievances ".
" In the same five year period that the United States says they [ the detectives ] were engaged in this conspiracy - ", Sokol continued -, " these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations, and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal ".
.
NO COMMENTS BY U.S..
In opening, D. Arthur Connelly, assistant United States attorney, read the indictment, but made no comments.
Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt.
Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler, Otis Sears, 45, of 6934 Indiana av.
Among other acts, Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears.
The first witness, Moses Winston Mardis, 5835 Michigan av., a real estate agent and former bail bondsman, took the stand after opening statements had been made.
But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings, two of the defendants, and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy, a man - mentioned in the indictment but not indicted.
Buaford Robinson, 23, of 7026 Stewart av., a CTA bus driver, was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st street and South Park way.
Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee.
His losses included his money bag, - containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck.
Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High school, 30th street and South Park way, and began " - skylarking ".
When 51st street was reached, Robinson related -, he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor.
As he left the bus with his money bag, Robinson added -, the largest youth accosted him, a quarrel ensued, and the youth knocked him down.
Then the youths fled with his money.
Mrs. Blanche Dunkel, 60, who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son - in - law, Ervin Lang, - then 28, appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members, John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier.
She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison, but former Gov. Stratton commuted her term to 75 years, making her eligible for parole, as one of his last acts in office.
Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son - in - law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934.
It was when he attempted - to end the relationship that the murder took place -.
The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden - to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20.
The defendant, William L. Stickney III 23, of 3211 Park pl., Evanston, who pleaded guilty to reckless driving, also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran - to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month.
Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing, Inc., 2544 Green Bay rd., Evanston, a food brokerage and grocery chain firm, of which his father, William L. Jr., is president -.
Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney - speeding north in Stewart avenue at Central street.
At Jenks street, Simms said -, the car skidded completely around, just missed two parked cars, and sped east in Jenks.
The car spun around again, Simms said -, before Stickney could turn north in Prairie avenue, and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie.
NORTHERN liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration.
They - have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state.
And both in their objectives - of non - discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons.
The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot; since Bourbon whiskey, though of Kentucky origin, - is at least as much - favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South.
The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons - is too little understood in the North.
The race problem has tended to obscure other, less emotional, issues which - may fundamentally be even more divisive.
It - is these other - differences between North and South - other, that is, than those which concern discrimination or social welfare which I chiefly discuss herein.
I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience.
A Southerner married to a New Englander, I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists, writers, publicity men, and business executives of egghead tastes.
Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves, and are viewed as, liberals.
This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism, because it is clear that these Democrats who are left - of - center are at opposite - poles from the liberal Jefferson, who held that the best government was the least government.
Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue - to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints.
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy, I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who - have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis; and the intelligent, cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any more in the world of to-day.
I am naive -, they say, to make use of such words.
I take this - to mean that the intelligent and therefore necessarily cynical ? liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that - will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it.
This seems like an attitude - favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which, under a President of the same stamp, would try - to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court.
As for states' rights, they - have never - counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms.
The American liberal - may, in the world of to-day, have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so - enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one.
Why, in the first place, call himself a liberal if he is against <bital> laissez-faire <eital> and favors an authoritarian central government with womb - to - tomb controls over everybody ? If he attaches little importance to personal liberty, why not make this known to the world ? And if he is so scornful of the rights of states, why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he - could more sincerely support - ? I am concerned here, however, with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South.
It appears - to be one of intense dislike, which he makes little effort to conceal - even in the presence of Southern friends.
His assumption seems - to be that any such friends, being tolerable humans, must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views.
<bital> Time's <eital> editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book, <bital> The Waist - High Culture <eital>, wrote : "... most of what was different about it (the Deep South) I found myself unsympathetic to -... ".
This, for the liberals I know -, would be an understatement.
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy, but something closer to the passionate hatred that - was directed against Fascism.
I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners - living in the North.
In business circles, usually conservative, this sort of atmosphere - would hardly be found.
But in our case and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration, nor are we given to emotional outbursts the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more.
In fact it has caused us - to give serious thought to moving our residence south, because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way - to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down.
Accounts - have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice, especially in state - supported universities where pressure - may be strong to uphold the majority view.
But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee - hatred - displayed in social gatherings.
From my wife's experience and other sources, this seems - - to be rarely encountered in educated circles.
The strong feeling is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South, especially among those who studied in the North.
And social relations - arising out of business ties impose courtesy, if not sympathy, toward resident and visiting Northerners.
Also, among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems.
There are of course many Souths; but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who have n't.
My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War.
Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category.
I suspect that there are far more - unreconstructed ones than the North likes - to believe.
I never heard of a poll being taken on the question.
No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic.
Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy.
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South.
Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more - in the older states than in the new ones.
Probably a larger - percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere, with Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama following along after them.
Old attitudes are held more tenaciously - in the Tidewater than the Piedmont; so that a line - running down the length of the South - marking the upper limits of tidewater - would roughly divide the Old South from the new, but with, of course, important minority enclaves.
The long - settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering, and there the memory is more precious, and the consciousness of loss the greater.
Also, we - should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands - centering on Charleston had closer - ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence.
The social and psychological consequences of this continue - to affect the area.
In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South.
Poor where they - had once been rich, humbled where they had been arrogant, having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation, the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt - extended to them by the mother country.
And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia, which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century, bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown.
Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors.
All Southerners agree that slavery had to go; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did.
Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending, the invasion, and Reconstruction; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties.
But apart from racial problems, the old unreconstructed South to use the moderate words - favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North.
And this, in effect, means most of modern America.
It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise.
And therein, I feel, many Northerners delude themselves about the South.
For one thing, this is not a subject - often discussed or analyzed.
There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it.
I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking : do n't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves.
Or else the North really believes that all - Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past, and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream, like everybody else.
If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this - to be true.
The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world.
Regardless of rights and wrongs, a population and an area appropriate to a pre - World - War - I great power - have been, following conquest, ruled against their will by a neighboring people, and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike -.
And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent.
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination.
The fact is due mainly to international wars, both hot and cold.
In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country.
So instead of being tests of the South's loyalty, the Spanish War, the two World Wars, and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion.
And there is no section of the nation - more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism.
Had the situation been reversed, had, for instance, England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues - of concern chiefly to New England, there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners - would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain.
It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have.
The North should thank its stars that such has been the case; but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom.
The two main charges - levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries.
There is much truth in both these charges, and not many Bourbons deny them.
Whatever their faults, they are not hypocrites.
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure.
Many Northeners believe this, too, but few of them will say so publicly.
The Bourbon economic philosophy, moreover, is not very different from that of Northern conservatives.
But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this.
They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America.
As it is, they consider that the North - is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism, that in spite of its high standard of living the " American way " has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways, although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter.
The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners, harsh accents, lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure.
Their own easier, slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners; and I have heard many - say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.
In the past, the duties of the state, as Sir Henry Maine noted long ago, were only two - in number : internal order and external security.
By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men, the nation - state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders.
Outside those limits it asserted, as against other states, a position of sovereign equality, and, as against the " inferior " peoples of the non - Western world, a position of dominance.
It became the sole " subject " of " international law " (a term which, it is pertinent to remember, was coined by Bentham), a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena.
(That corpus of law was a reflection of the power system - in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Speaking generally, it furthered and still tends to further the interests of the Western powers.
The enormous changes in world politics - have, however, thrown it into confusion, so - much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era.
) Beyond the two basic tasks - mentioned above, no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility, either internally or externally.
This was particularly true in the world arena, which was an anarchical battleground - characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires.
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth - century statesman.
His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation, and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated.
Thus, to cite but one example, the <bital> Pax Britannica <eital> of the nineteenth century, whether with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance, was strictly national in motivation, however much other nations (e.g., the United States) - may have incidentally benefited.
At the same time, all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state - was strongly resisted.
Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.
However, in recent decades, for what doubtless are multiple reasons, an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity.
A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment.
Already firmly implanted internally, it is a growing factor in external matters.
<majbrk> A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner.
In what - has aptly been called a " constitutional revolution ", the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature (the " night - watchman state ") to one with affirmative duties - to perform.
The " positive state " came into existence.
For lawyers, reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences, there has been a special fascination since then in the role - played by the Supreme Court in that transformation the manner in which its decisions altered in " the switch in time that - saved nine ", President Roosevelt's ill - starred but in effect victorious " Court - packing plan ", the imprimatur of judicial approval that - - was finally placed upon social legislation.
Of greater importance, however, is the content of those programs, which have had and are having enormous consequences for the American people.
Labor relations have been transformed, income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms, and all the many facets of the American version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom.
A national consensus of near unanimity - exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary.
Ratified in the Republican Party victory in 1952, the Positive State - is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on <bital> whether <eital> but on <bital> how much <eital> social legislation there should be.
The general acceptance of the idea of governmental (i.e., societal) responsibility for the economic well - being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history.
The other, of course, was the Civil War, the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation.
A third, one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance, - is now being traversed : American immersion and involvement in world affairs.
Internal national responsibility, - now a truism, need not be documented.
Nevertheless, it may be helpful to cite one example that of employment for, as will be shown below, it cuts across both facets of the new concept.
Thirty years ago, while the nation was wallowing in economic depression, the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow " natural forces " - to operate and cure the distress.
That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946, by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment.
Hands - off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning the economic side of the constitutional revolution.
In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of <bital> national <eital> responsibility for <bital> local <eital> economic distress won out over a " state's - responsibility " proposal provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation - wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states - afflicted with manpower surplus.
The American people - have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.
Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution.
Reduced to its simplest terms, it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era.
National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept - not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations.
A measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists in 1959.
Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists, a body of lawyers from the free world, the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties.
It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed, former colonial nations.
The Rule of Law, - historically a principle - according everyone his " day in court " before an impartial tribunal, was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare.
Recognizing that the Rule of Law is " a dynamic concept... which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society ", the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility " to establish social, economic, educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized ".
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non - Soviet world.
For better or for worse, we all now live in welfare states, the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well - being.
Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish -.
The hypothesis - ventured here is that it does, and that evidence - is accumulating validating that proposition.
The content is not the same, however : rather than individual security, it - is the security and continuing existence of an " ideological group " those in the " free world " that - is basic.
External national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so - guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations.
If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality, then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.
Reference to two other concepts nationalism and sovereignty may help - to reveal the contours of the new principle.
In its beginnings the nation - state had to struggle to assert itself internally, against feudal groups, and externally, against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church.
The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led, not more than two centuries ago, to the surge of nationalism.
(Since the time - span of the nation - state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United States as an independent entity, it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order, something permanent and unchanging.
) The concept of nationalism is the political principle that - epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure.
But it is more than that.
For it includes the emotional ties that - bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that - hold a large group of people together as a unit.
Today, as new nations rise from the former colonial empires, nationalism is one of the hurricane forces - loose in the world.
Almost febrile in intensity, the principle has become worldwide in application unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm -.
Historically, however, the concept is one that - has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group.
By subduing disparate lesser groups the nation - - has, to some degree at least, broadened the capacity for individual liberty.
Within their confines, moreover, technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace, thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied.
While the pattern is uneven, some having gained more than others, nationalism - has in fact served the Western peoples well.
(Whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world, and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects, are other questions.
) It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state - are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation - state attained its highest number (approximately 100) -.
But it is more than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is <bital> because <eital> it has spread throughout the planet.
In other words, nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application, both as to geography and as to population; it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world - wide basis.
Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty.
The former receives its legitimacy from the latter.
Operating side by side, together they helped shore up the nation - state.
While sovereignty has roots in antiquity, in its present usage it is essentially modern.
Jean Bodin, writing in the sixteenth century, may have been the seminal thinker, but it - was the vastly influential John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood.
Austin's nineteenth - century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking.
To him, law is the command of the sovereign (the English monarch) who personifies the power of the nation, while sovereignty is the power to make law i.e., to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations.
These fundamental ideas the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual (internal - external) aspects still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power.
The nation - state, then, exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control.
In fact, however, both principles - have always been nebulous and loosely defined.
High - level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision.
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies, in which " popular " sovereignty is said - to exist, and in federal nations, in which the jobs of government are split.
Nevertheless, nationalism and sovereignty are reputed, in the accepted wisdom, - to describe the modern world.
Is there a different reality behind the facade ? Does the surface hide a quite different picture ? The short answer to those questions is " yes ".
Both concepts are undergoing alteration; to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility.
As evidence to support that view, consider the following illustrative instances.
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that - could trigger the destruction of continents ? Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? Will the danger increase or decrease ? I - have just asked these questions in the Pentagon, in the White House, in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that - prowl for months underwater, with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which - are affectionately known as " Sherwood Forest ".
I asked the same questions inside the launch - control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming, where officers who wear sidearms are manning the " commit buttons " that - could start a war accidentally or by design and in the command centers where other pistol - packing men could give orders to push such buttons.
To the men in the instrument - jammed bomber cockpits, submarine compartments and the antiseptic, windowless rooms that - would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars, the questions seem farfetched.
There is unceasing pressure, but its sources are immediate.
" Readiness exercises " are almost continuous.
Each could be the real thing.
In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes - elapsed since " E hour ".
" E " stands for " execution " the moment a " go order " would unleash an American nuclear strike -.
There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks.
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels, switches, flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that - look like business machines.
They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details.
Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.
Among the policy makers, generals, physicists, psychologists and others - charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their " hardware ", the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call " scenarios ".
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it : " You ca n't have dry runs on this one ".
The experts - are thus forced - to hypothesize sequences of events that - - have never occurred, probably never will but possibly might.
Only one rule - prevailed in my conversations with these men : The more highly placed they are that is, the more they know the more concerned they have become.
Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security.
Only recently new " holes " were discovered in our safety measures, and a search - is now on for more.
Work - is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile, the experts speak of wars - triggered by " false pre-emption ", " escalation ", " unauthorized behavior " and other terms that - will be discussed in this report.
They inhabit a secret world - centered on " go codes " and " gold phones ".
Their conversations - were, almost invariably, accompanied by the same gestures - arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions.
One arm represented our bombers and missiles, the other arm " theirs ".
Yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, perhaps you and me and the experts.
These men are not callous.
It is their job to think about the unthinkable.
Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us and more Russians and Communist Chinese, too thought about accidental war.
The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle, a frail, meek - mannered Swiss - born sociologist.
He was, and is, with the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit pool of thinkers - financed by the U. S. Air Force.
His investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war, and safety procedures - were enormously increased.
In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration, basic United States strategy has been modified and large new sums allocated to meet the accidental - war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.
The chain starts at BMEWS (Ballistic Missile Early Warning System) in Thule, Greenland.
Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States.
BMEWS intelligence - is simultaneously flashed to NORAD (North American Air Defense Command) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, for interpretation; to the SAC command and control post, - forty - five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska; to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President.
Telephones, Teletypes, several kinds of radio systems and, in some cases, television, link all vital points.
Alternate locations exist for all key command centers.
For last - ditch emergencies SAC has alternate command posts on KC-135 jet tankers.
Multiple circuits, routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.
The same principle of " redundancy " applies to all communications on these special networks.
And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance, by special codes, that the messages actually come from their purported sources.
Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.
Only the President is permitted - to authorize the use of nuclear weapons.
That's the law.
But what if somebody decides - to break it ? The President - can not personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger.
He makes the momentous decision.
Hundreds of men are required - to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons.
What if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly, coolly, decide - to clobber the Russians ? What if the President himself, in the language of the military, " goes ape " ? Or singlehandedly decided - to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation ? Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers.
However, the system is designed, ingeniously and hopefully, so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.
Even the President can not pick up his telephone and give a " go " order.
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike the " go code ".
In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the " gold - phone circuit ".
A system of " gold " actually yellow phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the SAC commander and other key men.
All can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes.
All could help the President - make his decision.
The talk would not be in code, but neither would it ramble.
Vital questions - would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda.
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from BMEWS.
If communications work, his decision - would be instantly known in all command posts that - would originate the actual go order.
For these centers, too, are on the gold circuit.
They include the Navy's Atlantic Command at Norfolk, Virginia, which is in contact with the Polaris subs; NATO headquarters in Europe; Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific, which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases; and SAC, which controls long - range bombers and Atlas missiles.
Let us - look in on one of these nerve centers SAC at Omaha and - see what - must still happen before a wing of B-52 bombers could drop their H - bombs.
In a word, plenty.
The key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman, SAC's senior controller.
He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants, - all full colonels, mans the heart of the command post twenty - four hours a day.
It is a quiet but impressive room 140 feet long, thirty - nine feet wide, twenty - one feet high.
Movable panels of floor - to - ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information.
And Bill Wisman, forty - three, a farmer's son from Beallsville, Ohio, is a quiet but impressive man.
His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown.
His movements and speech are precise, clear and quick.
No question ruffles him or causes him - to hesitate.
Wisman, who has had the chief controller's job for four years, calls the signals for a team - operating three rows of dull - gray consoles - studded with lights, switches and buttons.
At least a dozen men, some armed, are never far away from him.
In front of him is a gold phone.
In emergencies the SAC commander, Gen. Thomas Powern, or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that - stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff.
At General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone.
General Power would participate in the decision making.
Wisman, below, would listen in and act.
His consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every SAC aircraft.
He - need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left, right next to the big red button - marked ALERT.
(There are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged.
) But Wisman, too, does not know the go code.
He must take it from " the red box ".
In point of fact, this is a beige box with a bright red door, about one and a half feet square and - hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman's right.
The box - is internally wired so the door - can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon (" It's real obnoxious ").
Now we must become vague, for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets.
The codes in the red box there are several of them - covering various contingencies are contained in a sealed X - ray - proof " unique device ".
They are supplied, a batch at a time, by a secret source and - are continually changed by Wisman or his staff, at random intervals.
But even the contents of Wisman's box can not start a war.
They are mere fragments, just one portion of preprepared messages.
What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed.
The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff.
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages, again in special codes, each message also contains an " internal authenticator ", another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing.
I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried - to start - transmitting one.
" I'd wind up full of.38 bullet holes ", he said, and there was no question that he was talking about bullets - fired by his coworkers.
Now let us - imagine a wing of B-52's, - on alert near their " positive control (or fail-safe) points ", the spots on the map, many miles from Soviet territory, beyond which they are forbidden - to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets.
They, too, have fragments of the go code with them.
As Wisman put it, " They have separate pieces of the pie, and we have the whole pie.
Once we send out the whole pie, they can put their pieces into it.
Unless we send out the whole pie, their pieces mean nothing ".
Why does Wisman's ever - changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? The answer is a cryptographic secret.
At any rate, three men out of a six - man B-52 crew are required - to copy down Wisman's go - to - war message.
Each must match Wisman's " pie " with the fragment that he carries - with him.
All three must compare notes and agree - to " go ".
<majbrk> After that, it requires several minutes of concentrated work, including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men - sitting at three separate stations in a bomber, each with another man beside him to help, for an armed bomb to be released.
Unless all gadgets - are properly operated and the wires and seals from the handles removed first no damage can be done.
Suddenly, however, their posture changed and the game ended.
They went as rigid as black statuary... six figures, lean and tall and angular, went still.
Their heads were in the air sniffing.
They all swung at the same instant in the same direction.
They saw it before I did, even with my binoculars.
It was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall, a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth.
In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree, no more.
A white man would not have seen it.
The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos.
Watching, they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land.
At once the whole band set off at a lope.
They were chasing a rain cloud.
They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow.
I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care.
The games were over, this was life.
Occasionally, for no reason that I could see -, they - would suddenly alter the angle of their trot.
Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction.
Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley.
Their gait is impossible to convey in words.
It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it, it is not a lope, it is not done with style or verve.
It is the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangling, legs barely swinging over the ground, head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target, a loose motion that - is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful.
It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.
They ran for three hours.
Finally, avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground, they intercepted the rain squall.
For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall, raising their arms and, for the first time, shouting and capering.
Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady.
They were studying the ground.
Suddenly one of them shouted, ran a few feet, bent forward and put his mouth to the ground.
He had found a depression with rain water in it.
He bent down, a black cranelike figure, and put his mouth to the ground.
With a lordly and generous gesture, the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows.
The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle.
In an instant he had sucked it dry.
The aborigine lives on the cruelest land I - have ever seen -.
Which does not mean that it is ugly.
Part of it is, of course.
There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous.
They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil - left, but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines - between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that - moves is a scuttling layer of sand.
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality.
But much of the land which the aborigine wanders <bital> looks <eital> as if it should be hospitable.
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush, has a peaceful quality, the hills roll softly.
The malignancy of such a landscape - has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean.
He tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock, a ten - by - ten - mile square - owned by a sheep grazer.
They went well - equipped with everything except knowledge of the " outback " country.
" The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree - clumps.
Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men.
Only there happened nothing.
There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree - clumps : only there was not.
It might have rained, any time; only it did not.
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise; only there was not.
They lay, with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them.
No one came ".
The white men died.
And countless others like them have died.
Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty - mile hike and slowly lost direction, were tortured by the heat, driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape, and who finally died.
The aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the land is hard and pitiless.
He knows that the economy of life in the " outback " is awful.
There is no room for error or waste.
Any organism that - falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done.
I do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self - conscious challenge, but I suspect that it can.
Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity.
.
THE FAMILY AT THE BOULDER.
SEEING an aborigine today is a difficult thing.
Many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports.
Others are confined to vast reservations, and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them - to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo, but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive, shunning camps, coming together only for <bital> corroborees <eital> at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch which is very low indeed.
I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived " outback " for years - to take me to see some aborigines - living in the bush.
It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation, even though the rancher was said - to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language.
Finally, however, the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover.
We followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth.
The rancher went a mile down this road and then, when he reached a big red boulder, swung off the road.
At once he started to glance toward the instrument panel.
It took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel : there was a gimbaled compass - welded to it, which rocked gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about.
The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland.
" Do you always navigate like this " ? I asked.
" Damned right ", he said.
" Once I get out on the flat I do.
Some chaps that - know an area well can make their way by landmarks... a tree here, a wash here, a boulder there.
But if you do n't know the place like the palm of your hand, you'd better use a compass and the speedometer.
Two miles northeast, then five miles southwest... that sort of thing.
Very simple ".
He was right.
The landscape kept repeating itself.
I would try - to memorize landmarks and saw in a half - hour that it was hopeless.
Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines.
They were camped beside a large column - shaped boulder : a man, his lubra, and two children.
The sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade - cast by the boulder.
There was also a dog, a dingo dog.
Its ribs showed, it was a yellow nondescript color, it suffered from a vari

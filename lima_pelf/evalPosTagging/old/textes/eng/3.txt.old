The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced " no evidence " that any irregularities took place.
The jury further said in term - end presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all charge of the election, " deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta " for the manner in which the election was conducted.
The September - October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye - to investigate reports of possible " irregularities " in the hard - fought primary which was won by Mayor - nominate Ivan Allen Jr.
" Only a relative handful of such reports was received ", the jury said -, " considering the widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size of this city ".
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws " are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ".
It recommended that Fulton legislators act " to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them ".
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said " - - are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ".
.
MERGER PROPOSED.
However, the jury said it believes " these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ".
The City Purchasing Department, the jury said -, " is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ".
It urged that the city " take steps to remedy " this problem.
Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law - was also recommended by the outgoing jury.
It urged that the next Legislature " provide enabling funds and re - set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected ".
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds - granted for child welfare services in foster homes.
" This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program " -, the jury said, but the State Welfare Department " has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives none of this money ".
The jurors said they realize " a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties ".
Nevertheless, " we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds ", the jurors said.
" Failure to do this will continue - to place a disproportionate burden " on Fulton taxpayers.
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.
.
WARDS PROTECTED.
The jury said it found the court " has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations " of two previous grand juries, the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee.
" These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms ", the jury said.
Regarding Atlanta's new multi - million - dollar airport, the jury recommended " that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that - will eliminate political influences ".
The jury did not elaborate, but it added that " there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ".
.
ASK JAIL DEPUTIES.
On other matters, the jury recommended that : (1).
Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and " a doctor, medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail ".
(2).
Fulton legislators " work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that - will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable " pension plan for city employes.
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office, the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department.

Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a top official said Wednesday.
Robert Snodgrass, state GOP chairman, said a meeting - held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience.
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm - was picking up for a state rally - to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker.
In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it - to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.
Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended.
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted - to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no and there were no dissents.
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face - is a state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative courses - must be taken : 1..
Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions - requesting that the Republicans be allowed - to place names of candidates on the general election ballot, or 2..
The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform.

Gov. Vandiver is expected - to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment.
Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue - approved earlier in the session as his first priority item.
.
CONSTRUCTION BONDS.
Meanwhile, it was learned the State Highway Department is very near - being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds.
The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways.
A Highway Department source said there also is a plan - there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.
.
A REVOLVING FUND.
The department apparently intends - to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities -.
Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds - proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin.
The Highway Department source told The Constitution, however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds.
Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution - Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.
Pelham said Sunday night there was research - being done on whether the " quickie " vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice - would have - to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought.
While emphasizing that technical details - were not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek - to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 - 31.
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29 - 5.
As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution - being offered there to rescind the action.
Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators - to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday - to back federal aid to education, something it - has consistently opposed - in the past.
Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution - to " endorse increased federal support for public education, provided that such funds be received and expended " as state funds.
Barber, who is in his 13th year as a legislator, said there " are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like - to see it (the resolution) passed ".
But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him - to offer the resolution.
The resolution, which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday, - will be formally read Monday.
It says that " in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds ", the State Board of Education should be directed - to " give priority " to teacher pay raises.
COLQUITT.
After a long, hot controversy, Miller County has a new school superintendent, - elected, as a policeman put it, in the " coolest election I ever saw - in this county ".
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a veteran agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush, a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee.
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election, and Bush got 402.
Ordinary Carey Williams, - armed with a pistol, stood by at the polls to insure order.
" This was the coolest, calmest election I ever saw - ", Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said.
" Being at the polls was just like being at church.
I did n't smell a drop of liquor, and we did n't have a bit of trouble ".
The campaign - leading to the election was not so quiet, however.
It was marked by controversy, anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence.
The former county school superintendent, George P. Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.
During the election campaign, both candidates, Davis and Bush, reportedly received anonymous telephone calls.
Ordinary Williams said he, too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election.
Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise.
" Everything went real smooth ", the sheriff said.
" There was n't a bit of trouble ".
AUSTIN, TEXAS.
Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's " abandoned property " act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers.
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.
Under committee rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week.
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers - appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.
Daniel termed " extremely conservative " his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31.
He told the committee the measure - would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books " since Texas was a republic ".
It permits the state - to take over bank accounts, stocks and other personal property of persons - missing for seven years or more.
The bill, which Daniel said he drafted - personally, would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other corporations - to report such property to the state treasurer.
The escheat law can not be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property, Daniel declared.
Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler lawyer - representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks - to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers.
" If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something to the economy ", he said.
" You take out of circulation many millions of dollars ".
Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman, sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount " to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance and pipeline companies ".
His contention was denied by several bankers, including Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B. Jones of Houston, J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.
Cox argued that the bill is " probably unconstitutional " since, he said, it would impair contracts.
He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing, since the bill was introduced only last Monday.
AUSTIN, TEXAS.
Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas - authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House.
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency - to establish county - wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age - to attend the day schools, permitting older ones - to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here.
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed, Parkhouse told the Senate.
The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County, saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.

DALLAS MAY GET to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. (Red) Berry and Joe Ratcliff.
While details are still to be worked out, Ratcliff said he expects - to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected.
" We're getting more <lsquo> pro <rsquo> letters than <lsquo> con <rsquo> on horse race betting ", said Ratcliff.
" But I believe if people were better informed on this question, most of them would oppose it also.
I'm willing to stake my political career on it ".

A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected - to give it a favorable report, although the resolution faces hard sledding later.

TWO TAX REVISION bills were passed.
One, by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba, would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized.

AUSTIN, TEXAS.
State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer - to pay -.
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot, when Texas votes on a U.S. senator.
Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole, sponsor of the poll idea, said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill.
The West Texan reported that he - had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee - to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22.
The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval, by two - thirds majorities, before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot, Roberts said.
Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice.
All Dallas members voted with Roberts, except Rep. Bill Jones, who was absent.
AUSTIN, TEXAS.
Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday.
Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill - passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet of 250 people.
When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114 to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas.
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse.
The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make - to a local water project.
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities - get money which Cotten felt - - could better be spent providing water for rural Texas.
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway Cotten's attack.
The bill's defenders were mostly small - town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio (Kika) de la Garza of Mission, Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs.
" This is a poor boy's bill ", said Chapman.
" Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds.
This would help the little peanut districts ".
AUSTIN, TEXAS.

Grover also would require junior - senior high teachers - to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching -.
The remainder of the 4 - year college requirement would be in general subjects.
" A person with a master's degree in physics, chemistry, math or English, yet who has not taken Education courses, is not permitted - to teach in the public schools ", said Grover.
College teachers in Texas are not required - to have the Education courses.
Fifty - three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co - signers of the proposal.

State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for - yesterday in a report of a " blue ribbon " citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program.
The report, - culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm, listed 10 long range recommendations - designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load.
The report called racial discrimination in employment " one of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion, and ADC dependency ".
.
" MUST SOLVE PROBLEM ".
The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars, said C. Virgil Martin, president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co., committee chairman.
" We must solve the problems which have forced these people - to depend upon ADC for subsistence ", Martin said.
The volume of ADC cases will decrease -, Martin reported, when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color.
These, he said -, are " two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups - leading to ADC ".
.
CALLS FOR EXTENSION.
Other recommendations - made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need - living with any relatives, including both parents, as a means of preserving family unity.
- Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.
Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements - indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday.
The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys - representing the eight former policemen - now on trial.
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons - to grant his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial.
Bellows made the request while the all - woman jury was out of the courtroom.
.
FEARS PREJUDICIAL ASPECTS.
" The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client ", Bellows told the court.
" Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property.
It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements - involving themselves and others ".
Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired, " You mean some of the defendants made statements - admitting this " ? " Yes, your honor ", replied Bellows.
" What this amounts to -, if true, is that there will be a free - for - all fight in this case.
There is a conflict among the defendants ".
WASHINGTON, JULY 24.
President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver - tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio.
The President spent much of the week - end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.
Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port, Mass., a White House spokesman said the address text still had " quite a way - to go " toward completion.
.
DECISIONS ARE MADE.
- Asked - to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White House press secretary, replied, " I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts ".
Salinger said the work President Kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing - on the address involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis - precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city.
The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns, who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence " by unfair and fundamentally illegal means ".
Karns said that the cases involved a matter " of even greater - significance than the guilt or innocence " of the 50 persons.
He said evidence was obtained " in violation of the legal rights of citizens ".
Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases.
In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been " unable to make a case ".
Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler, special prosecutor.
.
ISSUE JURY SUBPENAS.
Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons - involved in the election investigation, questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them before the grand jury.
Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure constituted intimidation.
Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning.
Karns said it was a " wrongful act " for Wexler to take statements " privately and outside of the grand jury room ".
He said this constituted a " very serious misuse " of the Criminal court processes.
" Actually, the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court ", said Karns, who is a City judge in East St. Louis - sitting in Cook County court.
.
FACED SEVEN CASES.
Karns had been scheduled this week - to hear seven cases - involving 35 persons.
Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with " complementary " miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another.
The cases involved judges in the 33d, 24th, and 42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward, and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.
The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns.
Two other cases also were under advisement.
.
CLAIMS PRECEDENT LACKING.
After reading his statement - discharging the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases - scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he would dismiss them.
WASHINGTON, FEB. 9.
President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs.
The President, in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships, build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child health care and general medical research.
The aged care plan, similar to one the President sponsored - last year as a senator, a fight on Capitol hill.
It was defeated in Congress last year.
.
COST UP TO $37 A YEAR.
It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers - now paying such taxes.
The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent 3 per cent on each worker and employer on the first $4,800 of pay per year.
The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent 3.25 per cent each.
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system.
The payroll tax - would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because the levy - is already scheduled - to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs.
.
OUTLAYS WOULD INCREASE.
Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits - paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963.
Both figures would go higher in later years.
Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years.
These would be paid for - out of general, not payroll, taxes.
.
NURSING HOME CARE.
The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1..
Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.
2..
Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital.
A patient could receive up to 300 days paid - for nursing home care under a " unit formula " - allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital - care credit.
3..
Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient.
4..
Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness.
The President noted that Congress last year passed a law - providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged.
.
CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST.
He said his plan is designed to " meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who - are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children - caused by an extended hospital stay ".
" This is a very modest proposal - cut to meet absolutely essential needs ", he said -, " and with sufficient <lsquo> deductible <rsquo> requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.
" This is not a program of socialized medicine.
It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed.
Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital ".
.
WOULD N'T PAY DOCTORS.
The plan does not cover doctor bills.
They - would still be paid by the patient.
Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships, and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools - can not now handle the student load - needed to meet the rising need for health care.
Moreover, he said -, many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they ca n't afford the schooling costs.
.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOOLS.
The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one - fourth of the first year students.
The schools could use the money to pay 4 - year scholarships, - based on need, of up to $2,000 a year per student.
In addition, the government would pay a $1,000 " cost of education " grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants.
Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966.

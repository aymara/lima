/** @mainpage
 *
 * @section sec_principles Principles
 *
 * The LIMA linguistic processing module is designed to work either
 * with a direct load of the dynamic libraries in the program or with
 * a client-server architecture. The API has then been designed as
 * sufficiently generic for this purpose. In particular, it uses a
 * @em callback strategy to manage in a single function several output
 * formats.
 *
 * The same API is also used either for analysis of simple text or for
 * analysis of structured XML documents.
 *
 * @section sec_classes Main classes
 *
 * AbstractLinguisticProcessingClient is the main class that
 * implements the generic LIMA API. Its main function to launch the
 * analysis on a text is AbstractLinguisticProcessingClient::analyze().
 *
 * The @em callback is implemented through a @em handler,
 * AbstractAnalysisHandler, that specifies the interface to handle the
 * different events generated by the LIMA analyzer. This handler is
 * closely related to the configuration of the analyzer concerning its
 * output format. The choice of LIMA output is specified by setting a
 * @em dumper as the last pipeline unit of the pipeline. A
 * dumper is a class that takes the results of the linguistic analysis
 * produced by LIMA and outputs a given subset of the information in a
 * given format. The list of possible dumpers is given in LIMA
 * configuration files.
 *
 * Implementations of the AbstractLinguisticProcessingClient included
 * by default in the LIMA analyzer are :
 *
 * - mm-core-client : the main client that performs the analysis
 *                    process on a simple text
 * - lp-xmlreader-client : a client that performs the analysis of a
 *                    structured XML document (XML parsing and
 *                    spotting of parts of text to analyze according
 *                    to an explicit configuration). This client uses
 *                    internally a core client to process the parts of
 *                    texts identified
 *
 * @section How to call the LIMA analyzer
 *
 * To call the LIMA analyzer, one must indicate
 *
 * - the name of a pipeline to be used, specifying the set of
 * processing units that are to be activated for the text analysis:
 * such pipelines and processing units are configured in the LIMA
 * configuration files (lima-analysis.xml and lima-lp-xxx.ml, where xxx is the
 * 3-letter code of the language considered for analysis)
 *
 * - the handler, adapted to the chosen dumper, and specifying what to
 * do with this output (may be written to a file or stored in memory
 * for further processing...
 *
 * The program analyzeText.cpp contains several examples of calls of
 * the LIMA analyze function. Here are some commented examples:
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_example_0 Initialization of the LinguisticProcessing client
 *
 * @code
 // several languages or pipelines may be configured in the same
 // analyzer client, the ones to actually use are specified on the call of the
 // analyze() function
 // here, we only configure the only elements that we want to use
 std::deque<std::string> langs(1,"fre");           // the configured languages
 std::deque<std::string> pipelines(1,"main");      // the configured pipelines

 // the configuration file lima-analysis.xml containing all the configuration elements
 // for the different languages and pipelines is given as argument to the
 // client factory
 // Then, an analyzer client is created by the factory: here, we choose a
 // local client that will load the implementation of the analyzer in
 // dynamic libraries

 AbstractLinguisticProcessingClient* client(0);
 XMLConfigurationFiles::XMLConfigurationFileParser lpconfig("conf/lima-analysis.xml");
 LinguisticProcessingClientFactory::changeable().configureClientFactory(
   "lima-coreclient",
   lpconfig,
   langs,
   pipelines);
 client=LinguisticProcessingClientFactory::single().createClient("lima-coreclient");

 // some metadata are used by the analysis: the minimal metadata required
 // are a language and a filename
 // (some other data can be given, such as date, that allows to
 // normalize relative dates)
 map<string,string> metaData;
 metaData["Lang"]="fre"
 metaData["FileName"]="test.txt"

 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection sec_example_1 An example of call to analyze() with simple text output
 *
 * @code

 // for simple text output, the handler only redirects the stream of
 // data produced by the analyzer on a ostream (here, a file)

 //ofstream fout("output.txt");
 //SimpleStreamHandler handler(&fout);
 //client->setAnalysisHandler(&handler);
 client->analyze("ceci est un texte UTF-8",
                 metaData,
                 "main");

 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection sec_example_2 An example of call to analyze() with BoW output
 *
 * BoW is the LIMA binary format for an extended bag-of-words
 * representation, including compounds. This binary format is readable
 * with the readBoWFile utility program (--xml outputs an XML
 * representation of the format).
 *
 * @code

 // for BoW output, we use a specific handler that handles the binary
 // format and write it to a file

// ofstream fout("output.bin");
// BowTextWriter bowWriterHandler(&fout);
// client->setAnalysisHandler(&bowWriter);
 client->analyze(text,metaData,"main");
 * @endcode
 *

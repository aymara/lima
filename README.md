LIMA - Libre Multilingual Analyzer
==================================

# TL;DR

LIMA python bindings are currently available **under Linux only** (x86_64).

Under Linux with python >= 3.7 and < 4, and **upgraded pip**:

At time of writing, the current version cannot be installed using pip because
the generated Python Wheel is larger than the limit. We are waiting for a
validation of our demand for a higher limit. That's why instructions below
ask you to download yourself the wheel and install it from your filesystem.

```bash
# Upgrading pip is fundamental in order to obtain the correct LIMA version
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ wget https://github.com/aymara/lima-python/releases/download/continuous/aymara-0.5.0b6-cp37-abi3-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl
$ pip install ./aymara-0.5.0b6-cp37-abi3-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl
$ lima_models.py -l eng
# Either simply use the lima command to produce an analysis of a file in CoNLLU format:
$ lima <path to the file to analyse>
# Or use the python API:
$ python
>>> import aymara.lima
>>> nlp = aymara.lima.Lima("ud-eng")
>>> doc = nlp('Hello, World!')
>>> print(doc[0].lemma)
hello
>>> print(repr(doc))
1       Hello   hello   INTJ    _       _               0       root    _       Pos=0|Len=5
2       ,       ,       PUNCT   _       _               1       punct   _       Pos=5|Len=1
3       World   World   PROPN   _       Number:Sing     1       vocative        _       Pos=7|Len=5
4       !       !       PUNCT   _       _               1       punct   _       Pos=12|Len=1

# Introducing LIMA

LIMA is a multilingual linguistic analyzer developed by the [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/en), [LASTI laboratory](http://www.kalisteo.fr/en/index.htm) (French acronym for Text and Image Semantic Analysis Laboratory). LIMA is Free Software, available under the MIT license.

LIMA has [state of the art performance for more than 60 languages](https://github.com/aymara/lima-models/blob/master/eval.md) thanks to its recent deep learning (neural network) based modules. But it includes also a very powerful rules based mechanism called ModEx allowing to quickly extract information (entities, relations, eventsâ€¦) in new domains where annotated data does not exist.

For more information, installation instructions and documentation, please refer to [the LIMA Wiki](https://github.com/aymara/lima/wiki).
